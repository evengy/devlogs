That being said, the game didn't really come together for me.\xa0This is probably a personal thing, but I felt kind of bored throughout the whole game. First of all, the gameplay was pretty repetitive and menial. I think that expanding the map wasn't a great choice as it just increased the tedium of finding the right rabbits, maybe having more variations or rabbits that look more similar to one another, to make it more risky to play.\xa0I think having a menial task like this as the main game loop could serve as a great vessel for horror but my other issue was that the game wasn't scary, and I think there's a lot of reasons why.\xa0Firstly there's no actual indication that you are in danger. The music is still calm and the vibes are still immaculate. There was at least one moment where there was a monster chasing me and I didn't notice. Having some adaptive music, maybe a tint on the screen or a vignette would have gone a long way. The other thing is that the monsters are complete nonthreats. I don't think I got hit once over both my playthroughs (during the jam and right now).\xa0They are way slower than the player, and not only that but shooting knocks them back and stuns them. Something I did in my first round game was have the monster increase slowly in speed, creating moments on tension where they're close but then you pull ahead but then they start getting closer.\xa0This forces you to get out of danger as quickly as possible too. Finally, there's never a moment where you are actually forced into danger.

I think it was the spikes that I died most on though. There were times when I had a powerup and it said click any button and in my haste to dismiss the prompt\xa0I would click my mouse to close the window and end up dashing to my death. There was also a section where I dashed through to the next room and I immediately fell down into spikes as the momentum carried over or maybe it was just\xa0me I forget but that section was a tough one to get past but I managed it a number of times and was probably more difficult for me because of jumping, gliding and dashing all at once\xa0with controls I'm not familiar with more than anything else. All in all, I think it's a really great game with a lot of great platforming in it, which is exactly the type of game I love\xa0and the artwork is stunning and some really great upgrade abilities in there too.

I think you took the prompt to heart with the story, too. Great job incorporating that.', ""I'm impressed with how much story and how many characters you created with this.\xa0\xa0The flying and shooting is fun, but I do wish it was a little slower and I could see a little further in front of me.\xa0 Still, this was a fun game that met all the requirements."", 'I really like the amount of depth you put into the story!\xa0 The intro story and characters were really great!', 'did you write a novel or make a game? j/k just felt like there was more time spent reading dialogue here then playing the game game play was alright seemed a bit to easy to me though. great aesthetics though\xa0\xa0kinda felt like i watching amazing world of gumball.. i honestly started clicking through the story once i figured out how long it was...but im sure it was a good story started good anyways. just adhd really started kicking in about halfway through the 2 cutscene.', ""I love the aesthetic of the dialogue and the transition to 3D during gameplay.

You have a real talent for writing engaging dialogue - the shmup sections between dialogue sequences was a great change of pace as well.', ""Awesome job with the narrative. The character's designs were very good and the shooting sections were fast paced fun. Love the genre mash up. Good job!"", 'Insane attention to detail in the narrative and a quirky cast of characters,\xa0\xa0a bit of a bullet hell in the last round which made for some fast pace action, will have to come back and see how it plays out if I choose the differing narrative options!

I\xa0see what you were trying to do with all the different characters, but it made some points of the story confusing. I had to write down everyone's name and role to figure it out. I also wish the plane scenes were zoomed out more. Being that close in made it really hard to dodge enemies. Otherwise, I\xa0love the concept, and hope there's a sequel on the horizon!""]",2.6,68,29.3,69.3,0.6000000238418579,3.5,95.80000305175781,2.06
