      "Clever use of mechanics.\u00a0 I like how hitting A and D created a rhythm, like a train on tracks. \u00a0I'm afraid I wasn't very good at this game, but I still enjoyed it.COMMENT_END",

      "This was cool. It took me a bit to figure out you needed to alternate A and D rapidly to get going, but once I did it was smooth sailing. I like the art style, I\u00a0think using the same base pixel size for the foreground and background would help it look a bit more cohesive. Nice work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool mechanic! Reminds me of the Pokemon Stadium minigame -\u00a0Run, Rattata, Run: Where you would have to mash a button then jump over the barriers. Similar concept, but implemented in an original way!I like the use of the mouse and keyboard, keeping both hands active.A bit of audio would tie it together nicely, but what you've submitted aligns with the task!

      "Very fun game and the visual effects are great, especially when you crash.\u00a0I agree with what has already been said about the controls and it would make a massive difference to the gameplay. Nevertheless, I managed to get a high score of 11. I like how the enemy UFO can fly on a diagonal and all of the interactions with the asteroids are really great, overall a very solid entryCOMMENT_END",
      "Visual elements are good and mechanics are good fit to task, congrats! I found controls a little bit confusing bc it is unusual and I am not sure how to use pulling beam because asteroids didn't damage the enemy. Still it was enough to be good!COMMENT_END",
      "The best I managed to do was to shoot one ship, I mean they are so good at shooting and I'm not very goot at positioning myself cleverly. But I like how you can't choose to go backwards, and how this is basically a game about multitasking simultaneously with asteroids and aliens. Good job!COMMENT_END",
      "Like others have said, the controls were the biggest issue. To me at least the physic object rocks looked a bit wonky when just bouncing off of other objects. Maybe a bit too loud for my ears, but that is just a preference.COMMENT_END",
      "Others have said this too, but intuitive controls would help!\u00a0 All in all though, I thought the movement was fun and unique, and it had solid potential!COMMENT_END",
      "The explosion effect is cool. Using S to shoot is quite counter-intuitive. Was it chosen that way intentionally? It makes the\u00a0game\u00a0quite\u00a0challenging. Since the tractor beam can be used to hurt yourself I found it easier not to use it, and I ended up not using it at all. My\u00a0top score was\u00a07:COMMENT_END",

      "i got addicted to this for a little while, ngl. i thought this submission was really cool. it's got this neat retro feel to it. the controls were a little awkward at first but i didn't really see what the big deal was. nobody said you had to make an easy game lol, the difficulty added to the fun for me. the movement and shooting (both fully automatic and precision) in themselves were fun, but the tractor beam adds a lot of character on top. i think a cool future addition would be additional heart pickups :) i hope you had fun making it, i'm coming back to this one.COMMENT_END",

      "Wooh I LOVE the art. The gameplay is also very cool. First attempt I got to level three before I realized how the \"mana\" worked and got to level 7 the next time.\u00a0 Not entirely clear what killed me but it is very interesting!COMMENT_END",
      "this has lots of potential! Im surprised how complex it can get with all the mechanics you added. Also the bee being sad when you attack it makes me sad :(COMMENT_END",
      "It was more fun and advance that I first thought. Good job! I got to level 10 but I couldn't figure out how to save it to the leaderboard..COMMENT_END",
      "Best game for me so far as I love card games and auto battlers, well done.COMMENT_END",
      "This game is really awesome. I like the auto play of the cards and it was clear exactly what was happening. There was a strategy for picking cards and dropping some. I'd love to see where you take this game!COMMENT_END",
      "Super cool game - I love it. Can't wait to see how you're going to develop this further (I hope you do). I really liked the graphics and animations and overall gameplay - super slick. Nice one!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool game, It felt so good killing that bee on the start, revenge >:DCOMMENT_END",
      "One of the few games I played on repeat! All the different cards being able to carry different strategies, slowly building up a wicked deck of various types of cards, this game rocks!COMMENT_END",
      "This is insanely fun and polished. You are definitely gonna go far this year.COMMENT_END",
      "Great game!COMMENT_END",
      "Love the game!! Love your art like always!! And such a great game\u00a0mechanic, it's very addictive and fun to play and try out different strategies!!COMMENT_END",

      "Really well-made game with good art style and all, seriously one of the best entries here,\u00a0but I feel like a murderer now.COMMENT_END",

      "Very very fun and well done! Always have loved deckbuilders but not much experience with autobattlers, yet it works surprisingly really well here - I like how you have a couple different playstyles mixed into decks already (straight up damage + crit, poison, or even books)COMMENT_END",
      "Another great game from you Loten! Super fun to play, really nice using Calculus to squash stuff! Very nicely executed, with unique art and fun jokes. Went for the book deck, will now explore the poison one.COMMENT_END",
      "Gameplay loop is fun and easy to understand!Buuuut i feel bad hurting all the cute animals lolCOMMENT_END",
      "Very fun game - the combination of autobattler and deck builder feels great. I like the design of adding cards that do no damage but increase your gold. The tutorial could be more detailed, but the UI and game design helped me understand the game immediately. Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "First off, I LOVE deckbuilders so I'm absolutely biased but I had a great time playing this. Honestly no criticisms from me,\u00a0 it's lacking some variety and a little bit repetitive\u00a0 but nonetheless I'm so hyped to see where this goes. This has reinvigorated my fixation on making a deckbuilder. I'm not fully sure what the primary and secondary mechanics are but they seem to be buying cards from the shop and combat. If you make it to round 2 please develop this further <3 It's already making my monkey brain happy seeing numbers go up and if/once there's more\u00a0\u00e2\u009c\u00a8juice\u00e2\u009c\u00a8 added I might get\u00a0addicted. Good luck!COMMENT_END",
      "This was definitely one of my favorites. I recognize your art style from the 2024 GDKO video and I have a feeling you will go far again this year as well!COMMENT_END",
      "This was incredible.\u00a0 Even in just a few rounds I was getting a sense for different strategies to lean into to get further.\u00a0 I could see this being a larger game for sure!\u00a0 Full five stars from me!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game! cool to see the bugs returning once moreCOMMENT_END",
      "VEry good and very addictive! Almost feels polished as well!COMMENT_END",
      "This was a lot of fun. It's pretty simple to figure out how everything works and it's so fun to get a juicy machine gun hit with a lot of buffs before it to wreck the enemies. Definitely seems like there's a lot of room to expand upon ideas in this one. I\u00a0ended up making it to wave 8 on my best run. Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool concept! I can see it goes further!COMMENT_END",
      "This is a cool concept. I love deckbuilders and I think there is something here but it needs some tweaks. I guess enemies will attack at some point but I feel I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any control on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen the way it is right now. Maybe you could add some secondary mechanic during the battle itself to influence the result, maybe something as simple as skiping a drawn card to play the next with some penalty?COMMENT_END",
      "Really fun cards, but would have liked to choose the card myself, really fun game though!COMMENT_END",

      "I have no clue what the bamboos were supposed to be as practically ever single enemy could be skipped to reach the end. The collisions were extremely wonky and some of the bamboo sticks could even push you into the traps. Throughout the game I had no idea what any of the abilities did, so I never used them. The combat didn't have much going on and it resulted in just spamming attacks until something died.COMMENT_END",

      "The mechanic is so simple But hell it's fun to play, It got me hooked for a while. I think you can still expand this a lot more, For example, regarding the big blue ball I thought at first that if you hit it with the normal ball it would break the walls in a bigger way (since it is bigger) I think that would be fun that you can hit other objects (balls or something else) and those objects react and break more wall creating more destruction and giving the player more score.

      "love the wall jump mechanic both core and secondary pretty fitting and does complement wellloved it!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game! Thecontrols felt very nice which made it an enjoyable experience overall. The controls were a bit slippery, which was actually very fun\u00a0at some parts but the levels are designed at points to make you do precise movements, which don't feel good.\u00a0I feel like the dash was underused, especially since it just gets taken away from you at multiple points.\u00a0Although it adds more of a challenge, just removing the player's ability to do something doesn't feelgreatand I would also consider the fact that managing to skip parts of the level or do it in an unintended way is way more fun - even if it's way harder sometimes.\u00a0Also carrying the boxes felt a little bit weird and they were VERY easy to smuggle in different places throughout the levels. The main menu felt a little unintuitive, but it wasn't that bad. A lot of these are little nitpicks but I think my main issue was with the camera.\u00a0With the speed at which the player is going if you head in a direction the camera lags behind you, leaving only ~15% of the screen focused on where you're actually going. I see you're using unity and would guess you are using cinemachine, maybe increase the lookahead time in the body of the camera? I usually do that for my games.COMMENT_END",

I appreciate the tutorial, was well done as well. The level design is clear and I like the dynamic feel of the game. Really great job, 5/5!COMMENT_END",

      "this was fun to play. i thought the menu could be more intuitive, i did get stuck a couple times before i got the game going. i wanted lest left-ride slide, but that could easily just be a personal preference.\u00a0the environment was engaging yet classy, my favorite part was the secret level.

      "Very nive platfromer game with elements of puzzles, haha. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "cute and buttery smooth!COMMENT_END",
      "love the player! very lovely! billy is love billy is life, i dont really like how the tilemap doesnt at all go with the player, but with a change of tiles i could see this getting successful, good luck!COMMENT_END",
      "Super cute! The idea has a lot of potential, and the premise of being a little blobby experiment guy gives things a fun sci-fi twist. I didn't love the character movement-- it felt very slippery and unwieldy, flying over platforms and bouncing off of walls in a manner that felt uncontrolled. I also really wanted to remap my box-grabbing key a lot of the time to something easier to use alongside WASD, like ctrl or shift.COMMENT_END",
      "Such a charming game!! i like the spanish speaking boxCOMMENT_END",
      "This was a fun platformer! I like the movement a lot it feel well implemented and the wall jump is great. I agree with what someone said about the boxes and the lava below, but I think that's my only constructive criticism for the game. Great work on this I think I played thru everything including the secret world!COMMENT_END",
      "Love the walljump it legit is the best feeling walljump ive felt ina\u00a0 platformer rn, really cool game!!COMMENT_END",
      "Movement and jump are very well implemented. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so fun.COMMENT_END",
      "I could see myself playing this game. I would tweak a couple things around the boxes in the lava, they float away too easily, kept falling because the boxes moved under my feet, also, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow to pick the box if you are standing on it because again, I kept falling in the lava. After that segment the rest was very enjoyable.COMMENT_END",

      "I loved it, got to 163 score! I think it could be expanded to be even better!COMMENT_END",
      "The blocking and parriyng\u00a0mechanics feels great. As for the game (I know this is a prototype, but in a jam one has to evaluate it as a game as well),\u00a0I can't say I didn't had fun, thanks to parrying mechanics feeling good,\u00a0but the challenge was clearly missing, the difficulty is increasing too slowly to make effect.COMMENT_END",
      "Very GOOD job. 5/5COMMENT_END",
      "very good This mechanism also appears to have great potential for integration and expansion into other genres.COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool Idea, I believe this was one very nice prototype and I can see this idea developing into a full game with cool mechanics and engaging story. I would love to see levels in which arrows are throw at you in a puzzle way so each time you\u00a0 try to parry or block them you have to think of the order of the arrows or which action you have to do. Very cool keep it up.COMMENT_END",
      "Very fun parry game and I think you could really make something cool. There are some things that need work but I saw in other comments that you mostly focussed on the main mechanics (100% okay to do so btw). So some feedback on your main mechanic, the parry is nice and I love the intro. I do wish the enemies would spawn and attack faster cus sometimes you mess up and you just stare at the fucker for 10 seconds. The sound feedback is great thoSo with some work I do think this could be real fun!COMMENT_END",
      "Deflecting the arrows felt really nice and satisfying, but I wish that the game had more mechanicsCOMMENT_END",
      "Very neat, first and foremost great job!COMMENT_END",
      "The initial experience was great (besides the tutorial in the menu not working) but the difficult ramped up too slow in my opinion. By the time I got to 20 score there really wasn't anything new but played to 70 to see if anything would appear, but no. It also felt weird how I hadn't died yet and just to confirm I didn't play and sure enough, you can't die.\u00a0Props for having audio at 50% and not full like most other games.COMMENT_END",
      "i loved it manit felt so good deflecting those arrowsCOMMENT_END",
      "Really enjoy playing this!! The mechanics are great, and super original! Amazing job!! :)COMMENT_END",
      "The mechanic works quite well and definitely fulfils the task.COMMENT_END",
      "pretty well made for a first round of gdko, I could safely say your going to round 2 \u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00a1\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aaCOMMENT_END",
      "Very fun base mechanic, it felt extremely satisfying throughout the whole experience! I think you nailed the audio and visual cues as others have said, it was all intuitive and made sense. Only minor thing was that the mouse sensitivity didn't seem to change even as I lowered it in the settings, but that should be a quick fixCOMMENT_END",
      "Wow you really pulled through with this! The timing feels great, and I love the use of both audio and visual cues to guide the player to spot the snipers. Also, bravo on the hilarious voice acting!COMMENT_END",
      "this is pretty well made for the idea that you're going intoboth core and secondary fits pretty wellreally well executed loved it!for 5 minutes straight didnt manage to perfect parry and got 0 killsim glad i didnt take samurai as my dream jobCOMMENT_END",
      "The troll creature in the beginning is 10/10, look at him fly.COMMENT_END",
      "The mechanics were super good! I felt that they aligned well. However, I felt a bit bored on the first levelsCOMMENT_END",
      "Mechanics felt so smooth. I liked the VFX of slowmo. It was challenging, but it was more interesting to play when there was a lot of archers. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Love a game that's all about parrying!COMMENT_END",
      "The mechanics fit each other well. It was a little tough to get started but once I got it down it was great. I'd like to see you continue to develop\u00a0this. Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Really love the mechanics and being able to shoot the arrow back at the enemy!COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool prototype. The graphics look nice and the parrying feels great. I really like the sound effects and slow down that happens when you do the perfect block, killing the dudes feels awesome. I think it'd be cool if\u00a0the difficulty were to ramp up faster or if it became a game where you could move around and stuff too if you kept working on it. Great job!COMMENT_END"

      "Cool puzzle game! It was a bit hard to understand, the first bit was easy, but once you got to the numbers it got a bit confusing.

I also thought I got the correct answer when they turned red at first, but once I\u00a0saw the numbers being formed being green I understood how it all worked.COMMENT_END",

      "The movement was a bit weird to figure out as further the mouse was from middle the faster you moved, but also, at least to me, it felt like horizontally moving was faster than vertical movement. After getting hit by the ghosts the movement speed never reset, so you are stuck with what you have. Also also pressingANYbutton on your keyboard teleports you back, no clue why only space is mentioned as even numpad works.COMMENT_END",

Don't get me wrong, the mechanics are certainly there, it just doesn't feel like I'm taking a photo, rather just picking the objects up. What I would have done is made the mouse the camera, putting an outline around it that acts as the \"frame\" of the photo, then using left click to collect the objects, rather than simply walking up to the objects and pressing a button. Again, I love the idea you have, I just would have implemented the mechanics differently if I were you.COMMENT_END"

      "Had maybe a bit too much fun with the boat movement as it could build up a lot more speed than probably intended. The fishing unfortunately bugged out and I couldn't enter that mode after just clicking to reel in the fish, which was apparently supposed to be hold reel in. Cute pixel graphics and fitting audio.COMMENT_END",
      "This is a nice little cozy game. Just chilling on the water catching some fish. I\u00a0do have to mention, that the boat movement is reversed to the rowing animation, it should be the other way around. Other that that good job.COMMENT_END",

      "Super fun! I love fishing in video games. This one took me a minute to figure out, but after a couple of tries I was fishing like a pro! Rowing around was fun too, especially once I realized that with the right inputs I could send my little rowboat careening through the water with reckless abandonCOMMENT_END",

      "I loved this game. The vibe is so chill, and I love the 3d/2d blended style you have going on. I wish the fish would head towards the lure easier, it was a bit of a pain to get the lure to their path (skill issue I know lol). But yeah, great great fishing game and use of 3d models.COMMENT_END"

      "The mechanics are there and they are fun. I liked the crafting mini game. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "I love the minigame its real fun, the game itself works but could use some polish. The artstyle is cute and the overall gameplay loop is fun only issues I have is that a few things seem unecesary. The energy part for sleep does not do much besides refilling maybe making trees respawn or smth makes this a necesity. Also crafting being inside of the house maybe if you could place the things you create that would make sense but now the house doesnt feel like it contributes a lot.All of these things are of course not that hard to fix and for a round 1 you did a very good job. I see you apologizing that the game is unpolished and I just want to say, be proud of what you made over 1000 people joined and only 200 managed to finish and you are one of them. Gamejam entries have a lot of bugs (even mine ) and thats okay.Gl if i see you in the next round and otherwise gl with the rest of your journey!COMMENT_END",
      "The crafting mechanic was quite unclear as I kept connecting the lines but for most of the tries it just refused to connect. After crafting whichever wood thing you chose you could still keep drawing even if it probably does nothing. The energy mechanic for some reason resets when you exit the building. In my opinion the cutting part should've stayed on space instead of mouse 1 as it is never explicitly told what to press and space just happened to be the last one.Cute art style in the few areas that had art, but the gameplay was extremely thin.COMMENT_END",
      "Congrats on managing to make a proper crafting game for a jam. It was cute and enjoyable. There was a bug where bronze axe wasn't doing what it says, it was cutting juniper tree instead, but that doesn't matter. Loved the crafting minigame, inventive.COMMENT_END",
      "very interesting overall, the timings of minigames are a bit finicky.COMMENT_END",
      "Two minigames complement each other well, many features and potential things to update in the future.\u00a0Overall, a good game worth trying out!\u00a0The only confusing thing was that when cutting trees it told me to press space when I had to press left mouse button, luckily I figured that out before leaving. Good job.COMMENT_END",

      "Great game! The sword as both an attack and platform to jump on is very clever. The art style is very cute too. Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "This was a lot of fun! I like the mechanic of throwing your sword and bouncing off it. It was a lot of fun to chain it and bounce up walls with it. I think the spike hitboxes were a bit large and coyote time on the jump would've been nice. Overall really enjoyed this, great work!COMMENT_END",

      "Cute little platformer! Was very fun once I got used to the controls. You picked out some nice art and music too. Pretty much my only critiques would be the ones Brainfart gave on his game dev stream with the game's handling. But otherwise, very fun, I would love to see this game continued.COMMENT_END",
      "Overall fun can cute game. Controls were a bit finnicky for me as I am typically used to using spacebar to jump. Some puzzles were great in that they could be solved multiple ways.COMMENT_END",
      "Great game, cute graphics and the mechanics were fun.\u00a0 I had a hard time with the controls, not used those, would have preferred jumping not being the same hand as the moving.COMMENT_END",
      "I liked the combo of having the sword be both a weapon and a jump assist!\u00a0 Good concept and execution.\u00a0 My only minor complaint is that the hitbox on the spikes seemed a little big, but that only really came into play in the first area for a second where I felt like I should be safe but still died.COMMENT_END",

I like blowing the leaves around and it's very hectic trying to get them all into the truck in time but fun! I like the art a lot, especially the animation of the truck spitting out a coin, it was the best. It's also a very polished jam game. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "Honestly this is a perfect jam game, and my favourite in this jam I've played so far. It has a unique and fun mechanic, presented in a stylish way, with good art and some storytelling. Also the fact that you don't even have to be good at it, you'll still progress and get to see all the levels is such an underrated thing for jam games, I do not want to be stuck on a level at all, so that you have a star system is great! Also I love the world map, it adds so much.Only critique is that I didn't really feel the need for the shop or the power ups, it was fun anyways! I didn't even understand how to use the item I bought before at the end when I read the description (I thought you were supposed to click on it)COMMENT_END",

      "This was a a fun concept that came together nicely! The core mechanics were unique and worked well together. The physics based action was fun, silly and chaotic leading the the levels being a frantic rush to tidy up. I especially liked the implications with the extension cord and giving the player a short time on battery was a nice touch to allow for some strategy!COMMENT_END",

      "What a clever and original game.\u00a0 I loved it. \u00a0One thought, I would start with easier colors to make.\u00a0 But still, this was awesome.\u00a0\u00a0One of my favorites. \u00a0Can't wait to see what you do with it next.COMMENT_END",
      "The idea for this game is great! Had a good time playing this!COMMENT_END",
      "Absolutely loved this!! Super relaxing, and super fun!! I could have probably ended up playing this for hours, would love to see this developed further!COMMENT_END",
      "Great game! Easy to understand, super hard to complete. Best kind of gameCOMMENT_END",
      "Dat is a unique idea! NOT the easiest oneCOMMENT_END",
      "Very nice and unique concept! Well done! :DCOMMENT_END",
      "Very fun game, I actually ended up spending a long time trying to get these damned colors to fit together. I saw that you intend on working on the difficulty curve, which would be great because, I'm no artist, and right now this game is HARD man.COMMENT_END",
      "It was fun trying to mix the colors, my kid liked the guy in the picture. I\u00a0had a lot of fun playing this game, well done.COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game but really hard, maybe i'm not good with color decomposition :DCOMMENT_END",
      "This was fun, I learned that I am good at getting close to making the right color but I am always like 1 off lol. I liked that it told you the answer after you failed so you could learn how to actually make the color because I really wasn't sure for some of them. Idk if it'd make it too easy, but I found myself wishing I could remove the color I just mixed in when I saw what the result was and I was clearly not going in the right direction. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "Finally! My random knowledge of color mixing is useful! Although, my knowledge seems to be lacking to a substantial degree. I really love games that choose to become some really out there niche type of gameplay. This game is a certified banger!COMMENT_END",
      "At first, the controls seemed a bit too fast. However, after some playtime, they felt really fun. I enjoyed grabbing the colors and quickly dragging them around. A timer and score system would add a lot to this game. I hope you continue to develop it\u2014great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Very interesting game\u00a0!\u00a0 Sometimes it is super easy, sometimes very hard. I have no idea how you make mud ! )))COMMENT_END",
      "I practically failed colour theory at age 16, so this was a bit of a struggle. Once I got a bit warmed up with the controls and mechanics it paced well but there was a real lack of progression. No clue why the colours had the names over them if there are only the main big colours that everyoneshouldknow.COMMENT_END",
      "I actually really liked mixing colors together to make complicated combitations and wishing I get them right.\u00a0I really want to see this game\u00a0grow and get more meta gaming like story and more polished graphics. I can actually see this being a cozy full-priced\u00a0indie game some day, inform me when that happens pls.COMMENT_END",
      "I enjoyed playing it. Im not that good in color theory, but i got some good win streak. Mechanics are implemented very well. Nice game!COMMENT_END",
      "I really dug this game. it feels very clean and sophisticated, with the nice groovy bassline and primary colors floating around. It was also educational - I never knew what colors made up copper, now I do! Very cool. The tank controls were a bit jarring to use at first, but it's an interesting mix of styles. I would guess that building this game is a good\u00a0learning experience as well.COMMENT_END",

      "Game worked well, and didn't feel too easy or hard. I love the detail with giving the colours names. But I had a bug where if I picked up the colour at the deposit box, I had to leave and then enter again for it to drop of the colour.COMMENT_END",
      "I like the idea, but I wish that there was something that said what colors you use to make some of the more complex colors, like burnt siennaCOMMENT_END",
      "I noticed that I am not good with colors lol. It was fun and addictive tho, well done!COMMENT_END"

      "567 without getting any fuel or shooting as I thought the game didn't have anything besides moving, whoops. The objects being physics objects was a bit wonky, especially when the rocks would only get pushed, not destroyed. A short and sweet retro game.COMMENT_END",
      "I really like top down shoot 'em ups, been playing them since the 90's. I think this game has a lot of potential but I think the hit detection was more than a bit too wide. Other than that, I think it's a fun game.COMMENT_END",
      "As people have said here, solid start!\u00a0 It was a pretty simple game but it met the prompt well.\u00a0 My only advice would be if you continue this game for future rounds, find something to give it a little razzle-dazzle to help it feel fresh since there are tons of space shooters out there.COMMENT_END",
      "Solid start for a space shooter! I like how the asteroids kind of have a physics to them when you hit them. I wish the enemies didn't just disappear when you shoot them, but other than that, everything feels functional and smooth!COMMENT_END",

      "I really enjoyed playing this! The concept is excellent, and the core gameplay is engaging.\u00a0 However, I initially struggled to understand how the cards worked. A brief introductory tutorial explaining their functions would significantly improve the onboarding experience.COMMENT_END",
      "I didn't understand what the cards did at first, but once I\u00a0figured it out it was quite fun! Very cool concept, good job! :DCOMMENT_END",
      "This is actually a super cool premise, I'd love to see it developed further!COMMENT_END",
      "First, congratulations on the concept: building your abilities with a deck of card you draw is definitely a good idea.COMMENT_END",
      "Love the idea, i was a bit lost sometimes with what card effect was but i finally found out most of itCOMMENT_END",
      "Incredible fusion between your two mechanics, both of which are well executed. Falling down that hole in the dark only to discover that you had made a card to help the player escape was a great moment.\u00a0The graphic juxtaposition between the two sides of the screen is a little harsh, so the two halves almost don't feel like they are part of the same game. Good luck!COMMENT_END",
      "I really liked the concept and making it quick to switch the skills by having it right there the whole time. As far as judging the game by the criteria, I think you did fantastic. I'd like to see this game expanded on.COMMENT_END",
      "This was a very cool game concept. I had some trouble with the camera and the light levels, but it definitely had strong bones, especially for a game jam game. At first I was very confused, but once I figured it out I thought it was very cool to go around collecting cards and getting new moves for my character! Good Job!COMMENT_END",

      "This is one of my favorite genres. The digging mechanics are very well implemented, these sounds and effects are very satisfying. I went through all the levels and pumped up all the abilities)) This is a very cool game. The only thing I would add is that the camera seems to shake a little when the character moves. But this is just a prototype, so the game is excellent! 5/5COMMENT_END",
      "so awesome! one of the nicest mining implementations i've played. i love how fast it is, especially once you upgrade. there was a slight bug sometimes when I was really heavily mining and walking around, i would kind of teleport a few tiles in one direction or another. Really really solid entry, nice work!COMMENT_END",
      "very fun, almost addictive, made me forget i have another 190 games to vote, very good game!COMMENT_END",
      "This reminded me of an old game called Motherload. I kept digging and digging and the progression felt so organic! Love the work and I hope you will keep working on this gem. Cannot wait to see larger area to dig, more resources and maybe some element of danger.COMMENT_END",

      "I loved this game. It has such a nice sense of progression and it's so fun to just destroy the whole screen once you get all the god tier upgrades. This was such a satisfying game, I would've absolutely played more if there was more of it. I think some music and some more involved mechanics would really make this game shine. Great job on this I had a lot of fun playing thru it!COMMENT_END",
      "Great work, feels great to play. The main mechanic of mining ore is so satisfying,\u00a0and I love the addition of the\u00a0upgrade mechanic on the laser. I'm definitely anticipating a top 10 finish and I'd really love to see the game developed further.COMMENT_END",
      "Maybe my favorite game so far just in terms of gameplay experience. The progression felt almost perfect.\u00a0Every upgrade, except for maybe the movement ones, felt impactful but not overpowered.\u00a0Never did the grind become too tedious or time consuming and by the time I was razing the entire final level it felt well-earned instead of a byproduct of really op upgrades. The amount of juice was perfect and made it insanely satisfying. There was definitely some lacking variety but I'd love to see more stuff in later rounds, assuming you get through and want to continue work on this. Amazing job!COMMENT_END",
      "Super juicy mechanics. Great progression. I got all the upgrades and it was super fun just spinning around and chewing up the rocks and ore.COMMENT_END",
      "this game is TOO GOODCrunchwrap Supreme levels of crunch. Art, Sounds, Mechanics, everything 10/10COMMENT_END",
      "The game looks great, love the color palette you chose. The mining feels great and smooth. I like how powerful you can get after purchasing all the upgrades. Looking forward to this game if you decide to expand it in future rounds. Great job!COMMENT_END",

      "This kind of game gets me hooked xDCOMMENT_END",
      "I think the mining and collecting mechanics were great and made this fun to play. The upgrades were also good and related to the first. I wasted too much time cleaning up the entire level before moving on. Fun game!COMMENT_END",
      "The amount of joy I felt upgrading my little foxie to MAXIMUM ROCK DEATH was euphoric. If you ever make it into a full game I really hope it's like a factorio style industrial game because then my life would be complete.COMMENT_END",
      "This was such an amazing and addictive game! Really had a great time, spent soo much time playing! Would love to see this game expanded further!! There was one glitch I ran into a few times where I got teleported to the top of the map, not really sure why, but I didn't get trapped, I just did more mining lol!!COMMENT_END",
      "I love this game so much! \u00a0Not gonna lie, played it for almost half an hour and got every upgrade.\u00a0 I was a rock killing machine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not even sure why it was so additive, but it was.\u00a0\u00a0Perfect score.\u00a0\u00a0I want more!COMMENT_END",
      "This was fabulous! I really hope that you continue to develop this game. I had so much fun just chillin' and collecting rocks :)COMMENT_END",
      "Games like this remind me how great simple gameplay can be when it's polished and cohesive.\u00a0 The amount of time I spent enjoying this game considering I'm trying to rush through 200 games says a lot about how much you not only nailed the prompt but made something really fun!\u00a0 That's five stars across the board from me!COMMENT_END",
      "I played a whole extra round where I cleaned up the whole screen after I got all the powerups, strangely meditative.I think this game has a lot of potential to expand on for future rounds.COMMENT_END",
      "Honestly surprised by how good this was just based on hownotgood the thumbnail is. The progression was nice, good sound effects and no ear blasting music looping in the background. With some story or enemies, just more gameplay, this could easily be in the top 10 that this jam has had to offer (at least personally out of 70ish games).COMMENT_END"

      "A fun weird game, and I love it. It's got some decent mechanics. Good game.COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool art style, not quite as insane as your other game from the jam (also how on earth did you make 2 games for this jam), but it's awesome nonetheless. I like the crazy fast movement, tho it does get a bit hard to control at times. I think I made it thru the whole game, I killed everything on the level with the cover art guys all over the place and didn't see anywhere to go after that. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "The visuals are one of my favorites, they are charming and create this mysterious atmosphere with surprisingly good animations and effects. Gameplay wise alright too, maybe requires some more unique mechanics to actually stand out from other platformers - even though art already manages to do that.COMMENT_END",
      "I\u00a0really like this. The visuals are like something from a fever dream. I\u00a0love the song, too. Great atmosphere. The wall jumping felt good (though the acceleration was a little intense)\u00a0and the attacks were impactful. I hope you get to continue on because I feel like this could go somewhere interesting :)COMMENT_END",
      "The art style is probably giving a bad first taste for players as this one has some good gameplay mechanics. I got \"stuck\" at the spawn of the first level as I honestly had no idea why I couldn't move, but the respawning spot just happens to be right in-between two blocks which makes moving left or right impossible. The controls weren't exactly what I would've expected but got over it quite fast. Well done all-in-all.COMMENT_END",

      "While the idea is there the actual implementation seems like a bit a hit-or-miss. The bar seems to float around either very wildly or get stuck at the edge. By the first gas station on the third try I was already quite bored as I had only gotten one message and at the second I crashed instantly as I looked down. It was a relief there was a timer on the bar instead of just instantly doing it, but the gameplay was rather stale regardless.COMMENT_END",
      "Very creative. Personally, I would have made the messages appear faster and require fewer keys to be pressed because I was reaching the goal before sending a single message.COMMENT_END",

      "Overall great game, I love the aesthetics, music, and gameplay. It's really fun to move around and dodge all of the obstacles and the moving platforms. One criticism I do have is that the movement feels a bit slow and the combat is finnicky, but it's not that big of a deal in the long run.

      "I really like this game! The style and music are awesome, and the spin on the classic mechanic of frogger is awesome too.The combat mechanic is the most unorthodox/innovative part, and at first it was unintuitive to walk into an enemy to attack them. However, once it became clear, partially due to the nice clean sword swing animation, it was a cool, minimal way to do combat.\u00a0I have one suggestion to kind of mitigate this, which is to have the very first enemy you kill be one that just wanders around and can't even hurt you. then the player will learn how to attack without the risk of failing before they know what they're doing. you can also have destructible crates/objects that can get the point across as well.but anyway, i really liked the gameplay and aesthetics of this!!!COMMENT_END",
      "This was fun! I like the mix of frogger with some fighting in it. I really like the art style and the crt effect made it look so cool. I found myself a little frustrated by the fighting, I wasn't ever able to consistently kill a bat without taking damage so I ended up not making it past the 3rd level when there were more than 3 bats lol. Great job on this it's fun!COMMENT_END",

For some reason i really loved the representation of how long you had left being a wheel in the corner and it was cool to see the lighting change with it.A tutotorial is always nice in a game jam game and was happy to see you had one. It was clear, simple and did the job.... and then i saw there was an interactive tutorial level too!? AMAZING! It also really helped to add more charm and character to add to the art style. The tutorial bugs throwing shade was a lot of fun and i think it demonstrated the concepts well.COMMENT_END",

Sometimes the bots like to get stuck and do nothing, but in the larger map they at least tried to win.COMMENT_END",

But seriously, I had the most fun in the tutorial, I wouldn't mind having a game about traversing more linear levels with your growing/shrinking ball.COMMENT_END",
      "Great game! Really got to look for feedback on this one. Would be nice to see what the enemies got in score making it a bit more suspensefull. Also not sure but you can click the items youve picked? If its the case maybe binding it to u button instead of clicking on it would be smoother with the other controls.Great fun and I love the art!COMMENT_END",

Apart from that the game was pretty fun, loved the art, the lore (even basic, who doesn't like a good old arena theme).

That aside, truly a challenging and cool game! :DCOMMENT_END",

      "Cool game concept! Not sure I understood what the cards were doing right away but with the tooltip you have in the bottom left along with the descriptions after each wave I was able to piece it together. I would love to see a little more player agency in the card rewards after each wave (instead of getting a random one) but I think you have a great start hereCOMMENT_END",
      "Very nice rogue like with interesting mechanics. I enjoyed playing it. But i think, enemies are a bit hard for the first wave. Hope to see more cards in the future. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Not a bad game, but it would probably be more comfortable to play with a Numpad (my arrows are broken)\u00a0\u00a0haha, and also maybe I would want the monsters to be weaker at the start and become stronger a bit laterCOMMENT_END",

      "Really cool game. I love the upgrades, I just wish the game was a little easier during the first wave because I almost gave up before I managed to progress with 10 gold. I'm glad I didn't, though, because the later upgrades were worth it!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game )Very cute monster designs!COMMENT_END",

      "haha i imediatly jumped into the first pit before i knew what was going on! Once i got the hang of it it was a fun little core gameplay loop. The mechanics were obvious and well implmeneted creating a tension that built as you progressed. A good ecxample of this is one of the jumpes where you need to go left after the lift but there is a battery pack on the righ too. It a tense split second decision as to whether you should go for more life or risk it in the unknown.COMMENT_END",
      "The battery drain definitely adds a level of tension as a mechanic! I found myself rushing to find the next battery right until the end (Thought I was going to lose when I missed that last ladder jump lol) It was fun to play as well, felt good :)Nice job!COMMENT_END",
      "Nice little game. I enjoyed playing it. I loved the sounds of the game. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Exploring is well done with the gimmicks and different areas, lowering battery level also gave a new objective to be as efficient as possible, which was interesting. Would'be fun to figure out what is the ideal route to collect all the batteries without dying.COMMENT_END",

      "The robot character is very fitting\u00a0with needing to collect batteries. Also traversing the landscape is fun with the moving platforms and ladders. I like that your character has the ability to fall through platforms too and while it works on the moving platforms, I didn't have a need for it so\u00a0would love to see more of this ability if\u00a0you take the game furtherCOMMENT_END",

Great work on this it's super cool!COMMENT_END",

      "Nice one! It felt like a cool complete game and I liked it for real. I spammed E to cut trees ... Only negative thing was minimap could be based on fire bc I lost my way while chasing pumpkins :)COMMENT_END"

      "Hey! Really nice cartoonish, sketch vibe to your art! I think it's cute! The music choice was fitting. One bit of feedback I have is since the mouse pointer is part of the controls, maybe look into how to replace the mouse cursor with a sprite (like the wizard's hand, or a hand made of magic, etc.) to 1. make it more visible, and 2. make it feel more like you're pushing the enemies away. Good job!COMMENT_END",

      "First of all, the art is great, very quirky and charming. After I figured out how to use skills, I feel like they actually brought new game mechanics to the game. My favorite was the shield, at first I just destroyed everything with it but the fact it also destroyed the gems (</3) was game design wise really good decision. It's nice that you managed to add this many features here as well.COMMENT_END",

On my first try I accidently trapped myself inside the building and had to restart but other than that it's perfect, definitely a top tier game this roundCOMMENT_END",
      "Beautiful art wraps this very polished platformer featuring a traditional fetch quest. I would had prefer a little faster movement as some areas are a little large (I went left first and had to backtrack). Also, in the vertical bugs section, it was difficult to see the red spikes at the bottom, maybe the camera could shift depending on the area. Great job overall!COMMENT_END",

I think I may have accidentally skipped a big portion of the game by stacking all of the rocks on top of each other to directly get to the cat ladies house... but that just shows amazing amounts of player freedom! (please do not hate me for accidentally creating speed-running tech) Anyways, good job on the game!COMMENT_END",

The platforming didn't always feel the smoothest, particularly the jump between the left side of the map and the cat lady house felt a little too far to be comfortable with the provided mushroom on the closest tile. I loved the little puzzles, though; realizing I could pick up the mushrooms and the bugs was particularly satisfying.COMMENT_END",

      "I really dig the art, and the quests were creative. For some reason I had a hard time pressing space, kept pressing x instead, I would've appreciated the ability to jump with up arrow instead. Went into the cave first but then after a bit I managed to lock myself in in the hay house...COMMENT_END",
      "Fantastic game! \u00a0Beautiful graphics with really fun animation.\u00a0\u00a0Easy mechanics and clever puzzles.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely one of my favorites. \u00a0So impressed with how much you were able to create during the jam.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you get to continue this!COMMENT_END",

      "This game is great. I love the art style and overall it's very polished for a jam entry! I think my only complaint is that it was a bit easy, but that's kind of a personal preference thing. Great work on this it's one of my favs from the jam!COMMENT_END"

      "Such a nice duality between the two worlds! I probably spend so much time playing this (checking my last comment was 30 mins ago...\u00a0) the music, the pacing, the SFX. Instead of making 2 mechanics you made two games!Stayed till the end to beat the boss. Congratulations on such a cool experience!COMMENT_END",
      "This game was so fun and addictive! I would love to see you expand on the game.COMMENT_END",

      "Really felt like there could've been a range and a magnet ability for gems. Overall the farming felt a bit weaker compared to the main game where all of the progression was felt. The graphic styles were nice but a bit different from each other which looked a bit weird to my eye.COMMENT_END",

      "Wow that was surprisingly addicting, my economy started\u00a0to ramp up really fast once I got that third flower into my farm and it was fun to see how fast I started killing enemies once I\u00a0got that going! One small thing I noticed (and I'm not sure if this was intentional or not) but the bullets I fired seemed to move with my character as I moved around instead of keeping their own trajectory in space.COMMENT_END",

If you were ever up to updating it, I would maybe reconsider adding pick range and range updates at some point. But those were literally the only things I was missing, oh and I need\u00a0more levels of course.COMMENT_END",
      "Awesome!COMMENT_END",
      "Real fun game and also one that kept me playing, only thing Id would change is the boss timer or make it an upgrade. I get that its for the end of the game but in a gamejam a lot of people will try and move on and it would be sad people miss out on that.Great job and curious to what youll do with it :)COMMENT_END",
      "this one sticks out to me :) i had a pleasant experience. was confused when i got thrown into battle, but was able to figure it out.\u00a0i love how far outside of the box you strayed to come up with a primary mechanic of cozy gardening and a secondary mechanic of deadly space battle and somehow they complement each other so well. that right there is a beautiful blend of creativity and capability. i hope you had fun making it :)COMMENT_END",
      "I love everything about this. Good job!COMMENT_END",
      "I loved the crazy idea of combining a farming sim with bullet hell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the unexpected pairing worked surprisingly well.\u00a0 The initial feeling of powerlessness transitioning to unstoppable space farmer was incredibly satisfying.\u00a0 However, I did notice the bullets felt a bit 'sticky' to the ship.Still, the overall concept is brilliant and genuinely innovative.. Fantastic work!COMMENT_END",
      "You have so\u00a0much packed into this game. \u00a0I was having fun shooting things and then suddenly it's like there is a whole other game going on back on the planet.\u00a0 I'm not usually a huge fan of\u00a0farming type games, but this was impressive.COMMENT_END",
      "Fun feedback loop! The two activities complemented each other very well. I would have liked to see the total number of gems collected while still in the spaceship (number go up, feels good). Like others have mentioned the bullets being parented to the player is a bit strange/overpowered, and the WASD + Arrow keys controls are a bit awkward.COMMENT_END",
      "The 2 genres work quite well together. The only thing i have to note is, that in the bullet hell mode, the bullets seem to be moving with the player / enemies. This was quite weird at first.The farming was suprisingly strategic, that's a nice touch.COMMENT_END",
      "I have to admit that bullet hell + farming simulator was not a combo I expected haha.\u00a0 It was a lot of fun though!\u00a0 Really solid job on this and impressive that your mechanics were so different.COMMENT_END",
      "I managed to defeat the boss, he was actually easier than I\u00a0thought he would be but still pretty cool. Having the farming and the space battles is a great idea and there's definitely a lot of choices in the game which lead to progression. The space battle section is my favourite side of things and I liked that the ship had a magnetic field for drawing in the crystalsCOMMENT_END",
      "Very fun game! I killed the boss :DCOMMENT_END",
      "i liked it, it was a bullet hell, then turned to a FARMING GAME!\u00a0hilarious, great game!COMMENT_END",
      "I love the concept of this game. The space portion was like a more fast-paced, action-packed version of the mines in Stardew Valley. If asteroids, space stations, other ships were added to the space portions, this game could be a truly great \"farm sim with spaceships\".\u00a0While your two dueling mechanics seem at odds, I think they pair together quite well. This is aided by the fact that you made farming more fast-paced and generous than in other farming sims (which is also great for a jam game).A very ambitious and exciting entry!COMMENT_END",

      "Such a cool concept. I do think the camera should switch between the players. Also some type of indication that tells you which player is currently selected. Another thing is that the platforming was a bit hard, the movement was linear so doing small tweaks wasn't possible. I think lowering the movementspeed and adding\u00a0some acceraltion to the movement would be an good idea, so that you can make those small adjustments.COMMENT_END",
      "Character switching was a really clever idea!\u00a0 As others have mentioned there are some things with the mechanic that could have been a little smoother such as switching camera, making it clear which character was selected, etc.., but overall I'm really interested to see where you take it!COMMENT_END",
      "Really cool mechanics and a fun game. I sometimes got confused with which button to press to change characters and ended up in a pit as a result so I\u00a0think if it was one button instead of 2 to switch characters it would make it a little easier. I'm sure my speedrun will be amongst the slowest but I'll share it for anyone that wants to beat my timeCOMMENT_END",
      "Interesting idea. I would have liked to see a more complementary use of the 2 characters. The player has to do it at the beginning. But later when it comes to tight platforming its not important anymore. It felt like I had to do a section 2 times instead of 1 time. In addition the hitboxes of mines were a bit to strict for my taste.COMMENT_END",
      "I really liked the switching mechanics and the camera only following one of the characters added to the platform puzzles. Had a lot of, well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Very interesting idea !COMMENT_END",
      "It was hard. and fun! and hard. I liked the switching mechanic!COMMENT_END",
      "I know this is a skill issue in thelargestdegree, but it was hard. Graphics were simple, but it worked well with the boxy nature of the levels. Simple fast paced gameplay, the respawning mechanic was a bit buggy with trails appearing after respawning and the characters clipping into each other.COMMENT_END",
      "I agree with the previous comment, I just assume that the first mechanic is switch and second is platforming. But a nice little platformer, you should add a masochist mode without any checkpoints.COMMENT_END",
      "cool game. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of hard to guess the primary and secondary mechanic with no description but I think the box is primary and rectangle is secondary mechanic. overall game is engaging and nice.COMMENT_END"

      "I really wanted to play this game, but it crashed every time a flower was on screen. I'm also not sure if every texture was meant to flicker black, but it added a nice feel to the game. Like it was haunted. I'll try to play again later!COMMENT_END",

I\u00a0think you did great with setting, graphics, and controls,it felt like a real place and a unique\u00a0world of its own. The economy is a bit off (to the player's advantage) and gameplay maybe not super fun (as expected when rushing a farming game) but it's bug-free and works as intended so yay I think you should be proud.COMMENT_END"

Would love to see this expanded upon it's a great start!COMMENT_END",

As others have said the movement felt very crisp and good, though I think the farming loop could be elaborated on a little bit (maybe some additional steps in there, like having to water the crops, or fertilize, or both) but you may be planning that already. Either way, I look forward to seeing how this develops!COMMENT_END",

      "Absolutely insane to have been done solo in 2 weeks! Amazing! The skill tree is a lot to look at, I'd love for it to get visually clearer, and the level selection feels odd, especially before you unlock a second level.

      "In my top 3 entries here (and I've played about 150 so far), the idea just feels so special and has a lot of potential in my opinion. I felt that kind of childish joy when encountering something really new and creative for the first time. I wished it was a slightly faster tho\u00a0and obviously that it would have more content in the future. The game actually kind of reminds me of scribblenauts! What a wonderful experience.COMMENT_END",

      "Interesting variation of typing games.\u00a0 I'd suggest using simple words to begin with like \"heal\" and \"strike\".\u00a0 Those could be used for initial waves.\u00a0 Then let the player add words for stronger attacks, in successive waves,\u00a0like \"medicine\", \"rejuvenate\", etc.\u00a0 That would give a good sense of progression.COMMENT_END",

      "After reading your instructions, the game was really fun to play. I very much enjoyed the typing out attacks with adjectives. I feel like this game could potentially be really helpful for teaching typing. I was even imagining further in the game adding numbers to increase attack powers or do multiple attacks, like \"sword slash x3\" to do a triple attack or something, and even\u00a0unlocking \"runes\" that are symbols\u00a0like[ %, _, @, ;, . (, )] to help train typing of\u00a0those more difficult symbols. Lots of potential, but yes nice work and very creative.COMMENT_END",

      "your game made me sweat ,\u00a0 add a chrono and i'm sure many people in the jam will start speedrunning it\u00a0. there is also a good gamefeel when it comes to make the\u00a0character\u00a0 jump . i'll take inspiration from your game to get betterCOMMENT_END",
      "Very cool looking game! Loved levels 6 and 7 )COMMENT_END",
      "I really enjoyed this game. The art style and music give the game such a great vibe. I like the ramp up in difficulty, the last few levels definitely get challenging. I really enjoyed that the gameplay was more focused on execution rather than puzzles since I'm bad at puzzles, but I\u00a0guess that's just a personal preference kinda thing. Great job on this it is so cool!COMMENT_END",
      "I made it to level 9. You really didn't pull any punches, man this game is HARD.COMMENT_END",
      "Okay, you can take your freakin lazers and just walk to round 3! This is such a rage inducing game but I can't stop playing it! Not sure if you are aware, on level 4 it was taking me so long to complete that the music stopped playing. You know like at a party when they turn the lights on saying hey get out of here already! hahaCOMMENT_END",
      "1. I'm loving the neon retro art (show me how you did it plzplz, especially how you got the colours around the edges. did you just paint the whole thing and import it as a single sprite?)COMMENT_END",
      "Simple yet effectively fun platformer! Loved playing through it, and your level design was fantastic! That last level especially oh man, that one was toughCOMMENT_END",
      "Really well made, great workCOMMENT_END",
      "A neat neon platformer! I had a little trouble getting the timing right on some of the jumps (I fear I make a bad coyote) but had a good time with the game overall! I can't wait to see how you develop this further!COMMENT_END",
      "This was incredibly addicting. it had the right amount of progressive difficulty. \u00a0 I really enjoyed itCOMMENT_END",
      "This is peak! I could learn so much from this.. You made your mechanics so well and it was very easy to pick up and play. It was fun and tricky, but not to overwhealming. Looking forward to your progress! :DCOMMENT_END",

      "love it brainfart! dont really know what the secondary mechanic is, but i love the smooth movement and the lasers!COMMENT_END",
      "The colors and particle effect was fun! The platforming too! Struggled with laser timings but that is a gamer skill issue lol.COMMENT_END",
      "Oooh really tough but thrilling game! The mechanics work like a dream.Not a big point, but I love the colors of the walls.COMMENT_END",
      "Cool platformer, lasers felt annoying in some levels but overall its good and engaging.COMMENT_END",
      "Great platformer, love the mechanics and the art design. The game feels a little bit hard. The jump timing, the windows between laser beams, and the time you have after deactivating lasers all feel very tight. But overall, very good game.COMMENT_END",
      "Great platformer! And epic music to accompany :)COMMENT_END",
      "Great level design and fun (and a little rage inducing) to play. Made it through til the end.  I liked how far you could jump if you held space, it made for some cool level design that wouldn't been possible otherwise, and since you have the variable jump it didn't feel floaty. Three things I wished improved was:1. Make the respawn a bit quicker2. A little flash or something to let you know that the laser is turning on again (like 0.5s before it starts killing you)3. Make it so if you are standing still on a button the laser doesn't reactivate (currently you have to exit and reenter it for it to not start again, which is completely understandable from a programming perspective, but it felt illogical in game)COMMENT_END",
      "It was tough, but enjoyable. I felt like the character moved master horizontally than vertically, which was uniqueCOMMENT_END",
      "Good job on aesthetics, learning curve, and game in general. The final level was satisfyingly hard. One remark is, since up key isn't used you could have used it for jump.COMMENT_END",
      "That was fun :)COMMENT_END",
      "Love the ambience of this game! I'm not great\u00a0at platformers, but I kept playing for as long as I could to try beat it! Didn't get very far, but still enjoyed it! Really amazing entry!COMMENT_END",
      "Nice platformer! The minimalist art is quite stylish with the colors and the bloom. I managed to get to level 11 (out of 12?). On that note it might be nice to number the levels, if it's an arcade-style game. Also the menu font could be made more easily readable.COMMENT_END",
      "Finally got around to your game. The mechanics are spot on and fit the prompt and knocked it out in the judging criteria. A good set of puzzle levels to work through. Could see this expanded with more level items. Awesome game!COMMENT_END",
      "I managed to complete all of the levels and it's great that you made so many and they are all really well designed. I\u00a0like that it automatically saves the progress that you made too and that you can choose to revisit previous ones.\u00a0 Also your\u00a0moving lasers are awesome! Not sure if anyone has mentioned it or not\u00a0but I did notice the music stopped loopingCOMMENT_END",
      "Very fun, difficult, and amazing visuals! There were some times where the jumping felta littleoff, but other than that I\u00a0have no complaints!COMMENT_END",
      "Super super fun and stylistic game. Hyper-focused mechanics and levels designed with solely those mechanics in mind. Visuals and colors are both pleasing and efficient. Killer music and atmosphere. And most importantly to me, a fun and challenging game. Well done!!!COMMENT_END",
      "Easily one of the most polished games I've played so far and one of my favorites as well too.\u00a0\u00a0Great looking, great sounding, and challenging, but not impossible.\u00a0\u00a0This one's a winner.COMMENT_END",
      "Amazing game! Loved the tricky puzzles. It felt like I was fighting with the lasers a lot of the time, but that's the fun of the game. I would love to see this continued.COMMENT_END",
      "I'll be honest, I would have preferred a full jump instead of a variable jump. I felt like I\u00a0was fighting it the whole time. Otherwise, this was a great game! Challenging platformer.COMMENT_END",
      "Gameplay was really intense. I never seen such mechanics, but i really enjoyed playing it. Very unique style of level design and use of movement. Really good game. One of my favourites!COMMENT_END",
      "This game made me break my monitorCOMMENT_END",
      "Wow. Just... wow. This game has changed my life. I laughed, I cried, I transcended. My cat even started playing, and now she's better than me. 11/10, would play again forever. Critics are calling it 'the Citizen Kane of rage inducing platformer\u00a0games.' A true masterpiece that has set the bar for all future games. Bravo, me.

      "The levels are mostly well paced and provide a good sense of progression. Jumping feels a little too floaty but that doesn't hurt the movement too much. The player seems to stick to walls and ceilings, that did get on my nerves a little bit.COMMENT_END",

The map, layout, scoreboards etc were all spot on for creating that atmosphere.The enemies and the world gave a interesting fututristic impression that made me interested in the world. There was definitly a forboding atmosphere to it all and it felt very dystopian. I would like to see a little more variety in the enviroment if you carry this on.

      "Very cool idea for a game! I love factorio and seeing the conveyor belts instantly made me happy. I like the shooting section it feels good and it's fun to kill the dudes. I think I needed more tutorials on how to craft stuff, I got my smelter to make iron bars, but I was trying to turn that into 3 iron rods that the belts need and I wasn't able to figure out how to get it to work. Really impressive work for 2 weeks tho, making a factory game and a wave based shooter in that time is crazy. Great work!COMMENT_END",

      "Really like this game! Can't wait to see what you do next with it! As others suggested I'd focus on reworking the UI layout, maybe add a few more tutorials to help the player understand what to do. It took me a second to understand the gameplay but when I did it was very fun and built my resources :D . Also maybe have the enemies paused while you are building and when you come back have them\u00a0\u00a0start a few seconds later. Every time I came back to that world they just swarmed me.COMMENT_END",

Really interesting concept, just specifically playing the healer and trying to keep the rest of your party alive but not having control over the actual party.

      "Great game! Implemented the use of switching the reflectors and riding the light really well.The puzzles were the perfect balance of difficult and interesting to keep me captivated.The eerie tone of the music gives you an uneasy feeling, but in a \"I'm stuck in a never-ending labyrinth\" sort of way.

      "Really cool idea for a platformer and speedrun game! My best time ended up being 7.59. All the mechanics feel really great and there are a lot of them too which is impressive. I would've liked maybe some more levels to really get to utilize the mechanics after unlocking them, but not a huge deal or anything. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "This was a super fun game. I love how youve taken the idea of a speedrun game and added the abilities to get it done faster. One thing I would suggest though, is that i unlocked more than half of the abilities after the first run so you could probably make it a bit harder to get the abilities. I would love to see this game get worked and improved apon with more levels and abilities. Amazing work!COMMENT_END",
      "Asking for a speed run is a clever way to increase playtime :) It could be little bit bigger map to see the effect of upgrades but good job at all!COMMENT_END",
      "I love the art and all the mechanics were very well done. I think a harder level would have made the game more engaging since players would have slow starting scores and the various additional abilities would be more able to boost their speeds.COMMENT_END",

      "I think you could do some cool things with this. I already had a pretty good score the first time around. I think you could push the speedrun part even further, for example at the start make it almost impossible to beat the game in a short amount of time. For example you can give the player the speed of a turtle initially or\u00a0you need to take a longer route because your jump is not high enough yet, that would be an easy way to extend the gameplay and could even be funny.COMMENT_END",

      "One of my favorite games so far - even if it is just a demo. \u00a0I want more. \u00a0I do wish we could adjust how quickly the mouse looks around (my screen was spinning), but the block movement felt perfect.\u00a0 Great game, please add more to it.COMMENT_END",
      "Fun box rolling game, brings me back to some early 90s puzzle games. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Yoo this game reminds me of an old game i played when i was young called \"EDGE\"I really love how you made the core mechanic and the secondary mechanic to complement the core its like playing edge but with superpowers lolvery well implemented, with more levels and maybe a little story telling like The Stanley Parable\u00a0would be fun!COMMENT_END",
      "I really like the size change system (as well as the block-based movement) - on its own its fun to mess around with! The charge switches were a cool expansion on the size system, although I was a bit confused at first on whether to grow or shrink to transfer the last charge.COMMENT_END",

      "Its a cool idea! It could be turned into a great puzzle game. Only downside was that I didn't have enough time to read the\u00a0\u00a0instructions before it disappeared.. :PCOMMENT_END",
      "I really liked this game a lot. \u00a0Very clever and unique mechanics.\u00a0\u00a0One small quibble, it's possible to move platforms into positions that you can't get them back from - suddenly making progression impossible (although\u00a0I don't know how you would stop that).\u00a0\u00a0Still, this was a great game - one of my favorites.COMMENT_END",
      "The instructions with the magnet disappeared before i could read them but i did read them in the description, the magnetic ability was awesome, and the dashing and movements\u00a0work really well. Good job!COMMENT_END",
      "Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "This was fun! I really like the magnet mechanics it adds a lot to the game over basic platforming. Also I like the secret speedrun tech to finish the game in like 20 seconds haha. I did hit a softlock with the purple ball getting stuck on the ground and not being able to respawn it, but it's close to the start so not a huge deal to get back there. Great job on this!COMMENT_END",
      "Nice idea, and I loved the gameplay, really coolCOMMENT_END",
      "Very interesting idea. It was fun messing with the platforms and using them to with other things in the environment to solve puzzles. Very fun!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool game with lots of interesting mechanics.\u00a0 Controlling the magnetic platforms was tricky at first, but become a lot of fun.\u00a0 I\u00a0see much potential in this if developed further.COMMENT_END",
      "Nice job, it is actually really fun, I loved the simplicity and the graphics, art design top marks, I would suggest having a skill tree to improve the jumping, in order to assist in those jumps, but nice one!COMMENT_END",
      "that was awesome. I really liked the core mechanic and I think you've got the art of slowly building difficulty down pretty well. I think some careful adjustments would improve it, like having a little raised floor that stops the ball in the ball puzzle, or maybe have the ball stop when it reaches a really really low speed, because I got hung up on that puzzle (a puzzle which i thought was really cool and well-designed, by the way), but I got hung up simply on praying for the ball to stop when otherwise I felt I had solved it. If that makes sense.but yes stick with this core mechanic or reuse in future games, because it's a winner for sureCOMMENT_END",
      "Was fun playing this on stream!\u00a0 Really unique mechanic.\u00a0 The idea of pushing and pulling the environment is really cool.COMMENT_END",
      "Great game, although a bit difficult for me. Similar to HalfSmore, I felt the game introduced mechanics too quickly. Honestly, I felt pretty confused. Although, that's not the point of the task, so I still gave you a great score because I see the potential and the mechanics were implemented well. The gameplay was still fun, anyway. Cheers!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game! The visuals were simple but could have been a little bit cleaner (for example some of the red was different shades). I'd also recommend reducing the amount of different colors. For example, black is clearly a platform and red is clearly death but one room in particular I walked in and now there's a lot more stuff introduced at once (even though the mechanics are mostly the same) which was kind of overwhelming. Speedrunning was fun and the controls felt nice. I'd recommend using a color palette (like fromlospec) just to give it a bit more cohesiveness visually, and it's a very small change that can be very impactful.\u00a0The UI was also just at random points in my screen which was a little bit odd. Hope you make it to the next round as I'm really excited to see where this goes!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game! The visuals and controls are clean and overall it's pretty fun! Seems like a fun speedrun game too, maybe leaning in to that concept could make it even better.COMMENT_END",
      "pretty fun game with a pretty cool concept. i was able to win it in 25 seconds though by flying over the top of the map using the magnet board thing.COMMENT_END"

This could save our children.COMMENT_END",
      "This game was so awesome, so addictive, and super well-polished! The math was really cool, I love the loop of doing two kind of inverse mental calculations, it creates a nice ebb and flow that makes the game really rewarding and allows the player to develop that specific skill as they play, which is probably my favorite type of progression in a game. This game would probably be really successful in school systems. It makes math fun and who knows, maybe it\u00a0improves mental calculation ability.COMMENT_END",

      "It's alright, though I'm really not amazing at math it turns out. Problem is, defense regularly calls for a 0, such as exactly 0, or 10, and 0 is not present on the in game calculator, meaning you literally can't block when the answer involves a 0 since math functions are disabled.COMMENT_END",
      "Cool game! Neat twist on the calculator game. You not only have to calculate a number with limited options, you also have to solve an equation yourself by keying in the number with no help from said calculator. Love the art, too! I see the potential in this idea, it could even be a Steam game, possibly! No negative things to say. Will be sending to my math nerd friend.COMMENT_END",

I find it tricky dealing with negative numbers because my brain hasn't done that in such a long time but it was great to test myself. Having the attack and defence is a great mechanic especially as they were so different. It's also pretty cool having different opponents and the sounds are great!COMMENT_END",

I would've liked there to be some end to the game as it seemed like it just kept going forever, or maybe I quit too early I'm not sure. I also thought the defense portion of the game was a lot easier than the attack, so I could've kept going for as long as I wanted, I just failed attacks sometimes. Great work on this it's a very good entry!COMMENT_END",

      "Very interesting game and very different from any other submissions.\nI see the calculator as the main mechanic. I think it would had been great to have something else to complement it instead of using it in two different ways, but I agree that you are actually asking the player to exercise two mechanics in their head :)COMMENT_END",

I would've liked to be able to see mine and the enemies health bar during the fights, I couldn't really tell how things were going until the fight was over. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "The overall feel was great but there is so much that could be improved. The most annoying was the AI just running around and past the edge of the world becoming unkillable, the cannons felt awful as they constantly kept missing compared to every other form of damage (rockets op), the camera swaps should probably be upto the player instead of on a timer, and obviously the graphics could be better.

      "Kinda surprised there was no mechanic where if you left the plant in either the sun or the water for too long they would also start taking damage.

For example, just having the rain come and go in different areas of the room\u00a0would add a great challenge to the game. Nice work, hope you keep at it.COMMENT_END",
      "Lovely art, I love a plant-themed game. A few things I think will make the game feel more intuitive: letting players swap plants' positions without needing to move them to another position first. The detection of plant moving seems to rely on the mouse position, so sometimes, even though the plant sprite is in the placement area, it won't move because the mouse is outside of the area. I think it would feel better if the detection aligned with the plant sprite. Still, very good job!COMMENT_END"

      "The mirror switching was great mixed with the platforming. Tough with the mirroring, but got used to it after a while. I assume I made it to the end because I didn't see anywhere else to go. Good work, and great start for an awesome game.COMMENT_END",
      "There is great potential for expansion.COMMENT_END",
      "Amazing concept! I don't think I've seen it before! The only shame I think is that sometimes the metrics don't align, as in a platform in one world won't be the exact same in the other one, so it does throw the player off a bit,\u00a0but other than that super fun!COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool idea! I've seen the 2 world thing a lot of times but I don't think I've ever seen it mirror the world like that when you switch, makes for some fun challenging platforming. I think I beat the game I made it to a point where I didn't see any platforms to keep going. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",

      "I\u00a0think the mechanic are quite interesting, but I\u00a0didnt really feel the progression, I get a new monkey every so often but at the end of the day I'm just clicking the same bananas and waiting for the stock price to go up so I can sell, even though the numbers go up, my experience is the same.Overall an interesting little gameCOMMENT_END",

      "I bought bananas today and randomly started eating them while playing this game, not even seeing the synchronicity until the third bite. As for the game, it's ok, don't understand much. I clicked one banana and monkey started going to it. I\u00a0sent it a few times and then noticed two more bananas. I\u00a0was wondering how a monkey could fetch all those bananas, but when I saw that I have 3 monkeys there was no end to my joy.COMMENT_END",

      "Very interesting mechanics and a cool concept toomy experience when i played it is how the sense of progression doesnt really stand out to me and i didnt really get the idea on\u00a0how the puzzle works and the way to solve it. When i was\u00a0playing what comes to my mind\u00a0was i eat blocks and become the same color and stand between blocks that are the same color as my character but it doesnt seem to be the way to solve it. (this also probably bcs im bad at understanding lol)but the game is cool i really like the concept\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008cCOMMENT_END",
      "This is a fun game. Was hoping for a little variety with the different blocks, but I guess I'll have to wait until you develop it. Good luck, this was fun.COMMENT_END",
      "Hey, I liked the movement controller very much, it feels great to control. A comment though is that I used the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmess\u00e2\u0080\u009d option and I think there was something weird when eating, it would not eat all blocks and sometimes it would eat blocks behind, not sure if I hit a bug or there is a mechanic around that. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the later maybe you can explain it in the game page. Also, the game looks a little too small. I believe you can still edit the itch.io page after submission, maybe you can add the fullscreen button?COMMENT_END"

      "It was a shame there weren't more gimmicks to the movement system. After a few levels it had really ran its course and could've used an upgrade or a sidegrade to spruce up the gameplay. The levels were a bit too boxy and repetitive to keep my interest as I kept getting lost in the exact same looking squares with the only difference being where the enemies were put.COMMENT_END",

      "its nice and engaging game. loved the mechanics.COMMENT_END",
      "I've been playing this for the last 20 minutes!! Really fun puzzle game! I agree with what other people have said about the switching the dice location quality of life changes. Apart from that, love it!\u00a0Would love to see how this game progresses if you choose to develop it further!COMMENT_END",
      "Quite enjoy waking up doing a bit of math! it's puzzly although I find a lot fo the time using + and - is just easiest (or even ptuting in the number themselves works! (i feel like should have to do a formula)COMMENT_END",
      "Really fun math puzzley game! The fact that this is your first game is crazy, great job! I like the mechanics of it in general and the upgrading between waves is really nice and adds more depth to the game. I kinda wish the special attacks refreshed after each round instead of being single use, cuz I found the game pretty tough with the death counter always coming for me. I ended up dying on wave 4 due to the death counter. It'd be nice if you could drag the dice back to any slot instead of the one the originally came from, I was trying to experiment and see what I could do with my dice and then it's kinda hard to drag them back to their spot and I didn't want to press R to put them all back. Great job on this tho it's really cool.COMMENT_END",
      "Just Wow. The gameplay is really fun and with some polishing it could really be an incredible game. Didn't had any major issue or issues at all tbh. Some quality of life like the ability to exchange 2 dices location without having to put one in another blank space.COMMENT_END",
      "This game had a bit of a learning curve but once I got the hang of it it was really fun! At times it was a little annoying to try and return specific dice to their starting spots, maybe consider letting the player right click a block to automatically return it to the set. Overall great game!COMMENT_END",
      "This game made me feel really stupid.... and then really clever.... and then really stupid again \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085. It was fun and engaging and I spent quite a bit of time on it. Unfortunatly my best run was cut short because i clicked the \"PEDMAS\" title, not realising it would send me back to the menu!COMMENT_END",
      "Wow, what a fun math puzzle game. Very well done. I think you got the core and secondary mechanics working together real well and they worked together to help defeat the enemy. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Somehow turns math into a really fun and\u00a0difficult strategy game! Found myself playing it for way longer than I thought I would.\u00a0 The special abilities were fun\u00a0and really spiced things up.COMMENT_END",
      "I really suck at coming up with equations to generate a number which made the game quite tedious to play, but that was on the tin so can't dock points for that. The UI elements, which makes up most of the game, were rather generic and could use some sprucing up if it were to go into real development.COMMENT_END",
      "i was scared there was gonna be integration in higher levels,it was really funCOMMENT_END",
      "I had a lot of fun playing! It would be nice to see more complex math in higher levelsCOMMENT_END",
      "Very addictive.  with some QoL updates, it could be a banger!COMMENT_END",
      "This is a pretty damn good entry. Though my brain would always shut off when quizes had these mathematical combinatorics games, I gave it a real try and was surprised at managing to match all the numbers. Well, all until wave 4 where I gave up as it is not my type of game, but pretty good work. One tip, I would recommend to put credits on the game page\u00a0so people are aware where the graphics are from, some jammers may get annoyed whet that is missing.COMMENT_END",
      "Wow this was super duper fun! I ended up playing a lot longer than I intended to but I think you have a great couple mechanics working very well together here. The UI had a few bugs here and there but with some touch ups and polish (and added music) this would be absolutely perfect!COMMENT_END",
      "Accidentally commented in the construct jam first lol. Anyway, missed games like these. Nice work!COMMENT_END",
      "This was sooo cool. I\u00a0have visions of a blockbuster AAA title in your future with ideas like this.COMMENT_END",
      "Cool game! At first I was a bit weary I'm not going to lie, but I had a lot of fun when I actually got into it! It really made me want to hold on to some of my numbers like my life depended on it lol.\u00a0(2, my beloved) Anyways, good job!COMMENT_END",
      "Nice math game! Makes me think of computer labs in school growing up and getting to play something like this.COMMENT_END",
      "i like this.. seems like a fun way for school kids to learn basic math skills..COMMENT_END",
      "Nice game. As a quality-of-life feature I would suggest that dragging a number back to the top to an invalid slot should automatically move it to a valid slot (say, the first empty valid slot, or the closest valid empty slot). Also, you could have a \"clear\" button to restart your current turn.COMMENT_END",
      "Well done! I enjoyed it! :DCOMMENT_END"

      "Good Game. Love the idea.\u00a0 But kind of Hard. you could give up little bigger reward after enemy dies like at least at the start or give up like reserve resource maybe like xp.COMMENT_END",
      "Very impressive idea on having to switch your resources between health, movement, ammo. I really liked that idea! What are you planning on doing next???COMMENT_END",
      "Interesting idea with the swapping around of stats. I can just hear the protagonist shouting 'I am out of bullets... I'll kill you with MY LIIFFFFEEE!!!!!\"COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool game design! It wasn't immediately clear to me that I could refill resources by entering the circle that is left by defeated enemies. On the other hand, after trying once without refills you'll probably realize that there has to be a way to refill, and you'll naturally try to enter the circle.COMMENT_END",
      "This is freaking cool! I love the concept where the movement, slowly drains the colors, and that you can also sacrifice your hearts for more ammo or movement etc.COMMENT_END",
      "This is the best of all the games that doesn't have a cover image, actually fun game requiring strategy and evolving with more enemies. Would be a great basis for a bigger and more ambitious game.COMMENT_END",
      "This is such a clever gameplay mechanic. I can't wait to see how this looks after round 2!COMMENT_END",
      "The resource management was a fun concept that worked well with collecting the resources from the dead mobs. Very fun idea well executed.COMMENT_END",
      "I really like the idea of rotating and managing your resources/abilities.\u00a0 Cool concept.\u00a0\u00a0Keep pushing that mechanic!COMMENT_END",
      "Not the flashiest game I've played so far in terms of polish, but was pretty fun and liked the concept of managing your \"abilities\" by choosing which order to kill enemies. Great concept!COMMENT_END"

      "There is a bit of a learning curve but after that it is an incredibly fun game. The mechanics are all well done and the style is super charming. Congratulations on making a great game!COMMENT_END",
      "At first I confused about how to play but it was fun to play and serving smooth gameplay. I also liked the animated part at start. Good job!COMMENT_END",
      "Awesome game mechanics, that is really fun. Top marks for this. Also loved the art style.COMMENT_END",
      "I managed to softlock myself by running out of black holes to get stuff from, but that's mostly a me problem. Very cool game, and well polished. I just wished it was a bit easier.COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool game. It took me a bit to figure out how everything worked, but I was able to win on my 3rd try I think it was. Once I realized you cold hold multiple things it was really fun to optimize getting the people their requests. Great job on this I really enjoyed playing thru it!COMMENT_END",
      "fun concept and fun game, maybe make the mixing os a lil finicky but i love it!COMMENT_END",
      "This is a pretty unusual game. This is the first time I've seen such mechanics, and I really liked it. The art of the game is very cool)COMMENT_END",
      "The art is very charming, the intro is very cool and sets a fun hook for the game. I agree with Loten about maybe breaking the tutorial a little but overall very interesting concept. I had some trouble where often I wanted to combine only two powder but 3 would combine instead. Maybe some cursor indicating what is going to combine may be an interesting helper to add.COMMENT_END",
      "Fun and addicting game! I'll have to come back to finish it after I'm done rating games. Your tutorial is quite intimidating. Consider teaching a little as the player plays, instead of giving all the info upfront. It made much more sense while playing, and I learned quickly. Fantastic job overall!COMMENT_END",
      "Not smart enough for your game )COMMENT_END",
      "The concept is something like an old flash game but with much better graphics. The intro and tutorial texts felt a bit too long, but the game was interesting non the less.COMMENT_END",
      "I like the idea of combining and selling stuff and art is\u00a0cute! I especially like the animations. I encountered\u00a0some technical issues tho. For example, the second time I relaunched the game I couldn't move at all. Also, I accidentally gave all my stuff away and was left with empty area. Luckily now I know what I did wrong (should've kept my black hole lol).COMMENT_END",
      "This is such a cool game. At first I was completely confused, but once I got the hang of it it was amazing. The sound design is soooo cool as well. Love everything about this submission! So much potential in this game.COMMENT_END",
      "The concept and visuals are very abstract!Really fun!COMMENT_END",
      "(Copy from game page)This was super fun!  The controls page was initially very intimidating, but it didn't take  too long to beat. Even in this short game you had a great sense of  progression and I could feel the pressure building as a played more, The  game became a manic scramble to keep producing black holes to keep up  my resources while fulfilling my orders. Had a great time! I'm not sure  how you'll expand this but this is a great little game!COMMENT_END",

      "The turrets were rather easy as the vertically moving ones could be dodged by moving close enough to the boss, and the horizontally moving ones had too many gaps for them to be any difficult. I only managed to get one upgrade because I was prioritizing health, but I couldn't really get any progression from it, but not going to dock points for that because skill issue.COMMENT_END",

      "The idea is fairly simple, but I imagine it makes up for that with the upgrades! Unfortunately\u00a0 I wasn't able to get them to work no matter how hard I tried. Top-Down movement is always fun! Would love to see more attack patterns and variations through rounds in the future!COMMENT_END"

      "The last level was a bit wonky as I couldn't figure out what the gimmick was so I just jumped the arrow, which didn't seem like the solution as it was having a spasm the entire time in the wall. No real depth, but the idea could easily be expanded upon.COMMENT_END",

The lag persisted through out the game but then there were also hard freezes for some time which made the platforming extremely annoying from losing progress from something beyond my control.COMMENT_END",

      "This is a really cool idea and you did a good job implementing it. I had a lot of fun playing!On level 2, my browser crashed. It looks like something in your code is probably causing a memory leak, the framerate steadily dropped until it froze then crashed. ( for example,\u00a0maybe something is creating objects over and over, etc. )Overall a really fun and expandable idea.\u00a0Being able to grab a platform and take it with me was fun.COMMENT_END",

It took me to a \"you lost\" screen instead of a winning screen. This has so much potential, and I'd love to see where you take it!COMMENT_END",
      "Great take on poker. The upgrading of the food was an awesome idea. I had a lot of fun playing this game.COMMENT_END",
      "Quite challenging game. It's a bit difficult to get a good build going, but it's satisfying when you do. It felt like a lot of the time was spent waiting for the competition to finish, though. That's my only nitpick, you have a pretty solid entry.COMMENT_END",

      "This is so fun. It took me a little bit to understand how everything worked, but once I got it I was making the best soup of all time. Such a great spin on the super auto pets auto battler type of game. I would've absolutely kept playing if the game were longer I was having a great time with it, I especially like being able to merge the ingredients. Great work on this it's very fun!COMMENT_END",

      "Really cool! Quite a complex game with the UI, but you managed to pull it off, well done! I wish it would show the specific things used in each poker hand as it gives the points, like 3 apples popping out of the stew when I get a three of a kind, that would make it even more engaging.COMMENT_END",

If only winning hands of\u00a0poker was this simple in real life -\u00a0 I'd be rich :(A little scary to begin with but once I'd calmed down and read the instructions I was bankrolling. Could benefit from a tutorial playthrough but time was obviously a factor in that. Great game.COMMENT_END",

      "i think this is a millions of dollars idea to be honest, it's such a fun game with so much potential. it was REALLY confusing at first but i powered through it and managed to win a bunch of times with grapes and other fruit. it was a lot of fun! stick with it, and focus on making the game as readable and understandable\u00a0as possible, and you could have a seriously great game on your hands!COMMENT_END",
      "i think this game could be potentially fun but it was to hard to understand\u00a0 what to do and how things were scored even after reading the instructions. Especially liked the\u00a0artwork. Did its job in\u00a0 drawing me in. Maybe make it a lil bit more clear on what to doCOMMENT_END",

I\u00a0agree with the feedback of some of the others though, it was sometimes hard to see my character with the background elements and I'd get stuck on things I didn't expect.

A few nitpicks:\u00a0it took me a minute at the start\u00a0to realize that the cursor was the location of my ship instead of something else like a target position of some sort.

Either way\u00a0it was very funCOMMENT_END",

I just wish there was a more elaborate \u00e2\u0080\u009csecondary\u00e2\u0080\u009d mechanic, maybe some currency gained while exploring that enables something to get out of situations or provides more visibility of the map, or a way to distract/redirect the AI.COMMENT_END",

      "Very fun game like always, challenging as the spirits always\u00a0 got me and won't say my death count... haha.COMMENT_END",
      "I'm so glad that you didn't have to restart the level every time you died, pretty sure I would've given up then. But I made it til the end with 19 deaths. Had to learn the timing to be able to defend myself, but then it was quite rewarding. I really like the visual and audio design, even if I got annoyed by the death sound since I died so much. Other than that, great entry! We totally have the same way of making games when it comes to trying to polish things from the get-go. :DCOMMENT_END",

      "i accidentally press w and ctrl and it closes the tab and i gotta start over \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00adi really love the idea, the combination really fits well for the core and secondary mechanic really fits the theme you're going pretty welli liked it alot nice work man!COMMENT_END",
      "nice gameCOMMENT_END",
      "I know this is a mechanics round, but I just wanted to comment on the art and atmosphere because it is really really well done. The cutscenes were sick!The mechanics were well implemented I think, the juice when using the psych power was helpful and the process of tracking down the links and progressing towards the grimoire provided a really solid progression.COMMENT_END",
      "Pretty great game! And the atmosphere was very creepy, I jumped a few times.COMMENT_END",
      "This game has a great base (interesting story and puzzle mechanics). I think the keyboard controls could use some work, but no issues if I had a NES controller!COMMENT_END",
      "Besides from the already mentioned issue about\u00a0character placement for interaction It was great, I loved the atmosphere and the mechanic over all, would like to see this developed further.COMMENT_END",
      "Very fun, nice and spooky! Only issue I came across was that ctrl+w closes the tab lmaoCOMMENT_END",
      "Art and story is soo good! Looking forward to the development of this project!\u00a0:DCOMMENT_END",
      "A very good atmospheric game! Solid work, almost too polished for the jam )COMMENT_END",
      "Solid aesthetics. Nice hard puzzles.\u00a0Nice entry!\u00a0I too had the problem with \"hit detection\" on the book. Figured it out, though,\u00a0after maaany tries.COMMENT_END",
      "Art direction and creepy feels were great. I died so many times to that darn thing. I think the biggest piece of feedback is making sure the robustness of the detection of the physic / switch and some\u00a0 others are improved as it felt like I was fighting it to make it work which made me question if I was doing it right.COMMENT_END",
      "The art and overall style looks amazing. Love the atmosphere. The detection of the book feels a little bit off, and I need to try multiple times to attack. I think it would be better if the switch stayed revealed after you use psychic power on the door. Still a very great game. I am looking forward to seeing how you can expand this game.COMMENT_END",
      "First of all, I like the general atmosphere and art is well done. But\u00a0I couldn't figure out how to use the book, I got it to shine once but nothing happened and aftewards the shine didn't reappear. Am I missing something? I would love to play the game more to see what you did with your mechanics!COMMENT_END",
      "The graphical style is nice, but the game didn't really work for me. Couldn't get the enemy to die/progress? as it kept repeating the psychic attack(?) animation and the book didn't do anything. Also the game itself and my browser crashed ones trying to figure out how the game works.COMMENT_END",
      "Wow, cool mechanics, it would be cool to see further development of the project.COMMENT_END",
      "A very nice thrilling experience with a cool backstory. Both mechanics were well implemented well and essential to progress. I liked the little jumpscare when you die. Don't mind the 14 deaths, I was testing to see if I can juke them, but yeah ended up using the psychic power to push them away. Good stuff. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "fun lil game! love the pixel art, it was a lil hard to understand but other than that great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Great graphics! I had some issues trying to trigger the psychic power in the right place, and at one time when I was playing with WASD and Ctrl I ended up closing a bunch of browser tabs (Ctrl+W), so I switched  to using the arrow keys after that.COMMENT_END",
      "As always, art, sound, and polish are incredible.\u00a0 It took me a second to figure out how to play even with the instructions, but that might have just been a skill issue on my end haha.\u00a0 Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool SFX!COMMENT_END",
      "Yikes a jumpscare! \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b1COMMENT_END",
      "This is super fun :) I think that if this were a movie the twist at the end would be that we were dead the whole time... at least after the first 10 seconds... I died 23 times.That would be a good leaderboard, most deaths by poltergeist :)COMMENT_END",
      "I tried to play it a bit, but I just never play scary games, hate to be scared!But yeah the art and music are nice and spot-on for those kinds of games.COMMENT_END",
      "This game was great. I really enjoyed the mechanic that showed where the hidden levers and switches for the door was. I appreciated that the game kept doors and stuff open after getting killed, cuz I was getting wrecked in the first real level until I got a hang of everything. Great work on this it's really cool!COMMENT_END",
      "This is an incredible prototype. The only problem I\u00a0can even think of is that some of the areas are wonky. Otherwise, great job! 10/10COMMENT_END",
      "This was really fun! I like how the level doesn't fully reset when you lose. The art and music were great and really fit the theme of the game!COMMENT_END",
      "impressive that you made this in 2 weeks! good job!COMMENT_END",
      "Glad to see some of your art back in this competition, looks really great. Hitboxes are a bit tight for my taste. Love the setup and curious to see more of this !COMMENT_END",
      "Solid game! It's hard to time your repelling blast when they beeline towards you, due to the delay, because sometimes I blast the moment one starts its attack but I'm still too slow. But I'm happy that the progress through a level doesn't reset after a death :D it does remove some of the fear of dying, but otherwise I don't think I would've finished the game.COMMENT_END",
      "you scared me haha.My only complaint is that it is a bit hard to hit the stuff even if you think you are closeCOMMENT_END",
      "man the art is amazing! I love how the ghost sprites fade in and out, move through walls and are sort of visible. The SFX, the jump scares! THE COZY ROOMS I MEAN WOW! I want to live there if it wasn't for the ghosts (great design on their faces as well!)COMMENT_END",
      "the art is really goodand i also liked repelling the ghost as it screamsCOMMENT_END",
      "Very cool game concept, I like the mechanics you have in place a lot! My only issue would be that the timing of using your psychic power to repel gheists getting close to you felt very finnicky, I had multiple times where I was using it as they were next to me and they seemed to ignore it and still get me. With that fixed though (or maybe explained more, I could have been missing something) then I could see this being fantastic overall!COMMENT_END",
      "With 55 deaths I\u00a0guess I've put some effort. Good amount of polish and captivating atmosphere. The spirit's reactions to player made it really creepy, you can just feel its rage. I\u00a0was quite annoyed in 2nd level until catching the ropes, most of my deaths happened there I think. It sure was clever decision to not reset level on death.COMMENT_END",
      "As always, your art looks great. I might have to get my daughter to play this one and see if we can get some jump scares out of her. Fantastic job!COMMENT_END",
      "interesting game! I already liked your games from last year, and this one catches that same vibe. I really ejoyed the experience.COMMENT_END"

      "This is great! Well doneCOMMENT_END",

      "Fun game! Your gameplay loop is really nice and feed into itself very well, but I think it could afford to get more difficult as time progresses. I'd also like to see some sort of\u00a0tooltip on the pumpkins to see what they do as it took me a little bit to figure out some of them. It's a really good base game though, kept me hooked for quite a while!COMMENT_END",
      "This was a ton of fun. One bug I ran into, I think the health might have gone negative and I could not die. Other than that fantastic!COMMENT_END",
      "Great theme and idea!COMMENT_END",
      "I really enjoyed this game. It's crazy to me that someone else thought of making a bullet hellish survivors type game mixed with a farming game and it's so different than mine still. I really liked planting my pumpkin seeds and having them help defend against the ghosts and shooty guys. Unfortunately I ran into a bug where my health bar was empty but I couldn't die so it just kept going forever, but I think my health bar became empty towards the end of night 3 with like 250 of the things harvesting pumpkins give you for my high score.COMMENT_END",
      "Great game! Loved the farming and mob wave mechanics. Very tough for me, I'll have to give it another few attempts.COMMENT_END",
      "WOW AMAZING WORK! I love the cover art and the big pumpkins. Very fun and unique game! I would like to have some type of visual indication when I get hurt, also making the \"monsters\" disappear when daytime comes would be great!Good Job! :DCOMMENT_END",
      "epicCOMMENT_END",
      "I really liked the concept of this game. I was terrified at first when I was just farming peacefully then i got ambushed by ghosts LOL. I kinda wish that the difficulty ramped up more slowly, but it's a prototype after all. Nice work!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool game! I like that it is basically a tower defense type of game but you kind of grow your tower (Pumpkin). The mechanics are very creative, and the art is very appealing. The suggestion I have is to make a separate UI counter for seed husk since it is not an item you can directly use. I also wish there was some text information explaining what your pumpkin does. You have many different kinds of pumpkins in the game, but in my mind they feel the same because I don't know their functions. Still a very great game - looking forward to this game being expanded in future rounds!COMMENT_END",
      "Great submission! I was a little confused at first but the game was really goof for figuring new things out every time i played! Once i figured the loop out i was unstoppable! (untill i died). I played through a couple of times and got a little further each time. I think you said in a reply that you had lots of ideas and wanted to implement a shop system, I think this would be really good and build well on the core mechanics you have already implemented.I thoguht the pixel art was very nice. especially the vines wrapped around the health bar and the pumpkins. The effects of the seeds turning into pumpkins was very satisfying too, especially when you had a bunch of them and watched them all change in a row!The enemies that shot you had just the right level of frustrating behaviour. They always seemed to just dodge away, but it was really satisfying when i finally managed to group them all up and mow them down.The music was nice and fit the atmopshere well witout being distracting.COMMENT_END",
      "niceCOMMENT_END",
      "Trying this again after the immortal state is gone and it is quite tough trying to chase those eyes and dodge their attacks while also getting chased by ghosts lol. Fortunately though the attacks on holding LMB really helped this time and I could survive forever but had to stop at 393. The healing pumpkin really helps you survive, more so when getting a couple of them next to each others. I also agree with the suggestions below regarding knockbacks and peaceful morning. Very fun game! Good job!COMMENT_END",
      "rated it, reminds me of anime where he farm at day but go adventure at night. forgot the name tho, saw a bug, I cant die. I dont know how it happened maybe you forgot to put death state in some cases.all in all good mechanics. if you going to use other assets try to pick a color palette in Lospec and recolor the assets with it so it will be coherent with each other. or maybe thats you assets IDK, wish I can scroll up and down to pick the items inventory for quick access of it insteead of pressing key numbers. good take on the jam no doubt you're in top 50, would love to see this develop further, Good Luck! \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u0096\u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00a1\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aaCOMMENT_END",

      "Well this one was quite buggy on all fronts. Just by not playing you instantly run into a platform's side and get stuck, if you manage to get out of that you fall right through the ground. Some of the surfaces remove HP while others don't seem to do anything. Graphical style was the high-point, but that's most that can be said.COMMENT_END",

It was cool that you could drag all 3 items on the belt across at once too. I liked the upgrade mechanic when taking breaks a lot, added some nice variety to the game as things progressed. I\u00a0think I ran into a bug where I could take my break past the time and my stress level would keep going down rather than skyrocketing like I think it said in the tutorial. I didn't abuse that tho cuz I wanted my score to be legit so I always ended my break on time! Great work on this it's super fun!COMMENT_END",

      "This game was awesome. I really like the fast movement and once I got a hang of the controls it was really fun to use both dashes to navigate the levels. Great job on the art and effects too the game looks really nice. I like that it got pretty challenging towards the end too, would've been nice if there were some optional collectibles that really cranked up the difficulty. I beat the game in 450sec, great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "Nice entry, i had some difficulties with understanding for which things I should boost, and i got myself softlocked in the later level (it had bright surroundings, i think it was thime cathedral or something). Before the level started, where the countdown happened, i pressed left mouse button a couple of times so when the level started i was already in mid air falling to my death. Unfortunetly it saved when i was falling, so i couldnt recover myself.Other than that a great entry, good job!COMMENT_END",

      "This is a very challenging platformer. I really like the idea (as you can see from my game, I also implemented a dash mechanic) but I found the mouse control a little confusing and overall a little to difficult given the speed and tight expectations to make some jumps. I think its a difficult problem because I also tried allowing players to aim with the mouse and then decided to backtrack it so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all keyboard based. I saw you played mine and you seemed to like the mechanics, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear more of your thoughts on my control scheme. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still debating and may change it for next round if I make it.COMMENT_END",

      "neat game visually speaking it's eye catching. the gameplay is superb tho Im not very good at the no movement mechanics of it. also sometimes if you got too close in a wall the projectile you spawned will get destroyed so leaving stuck in a wall. like step sis. (sorry, I had to say it.)my only suggestion is that the text could do a bit more fixing since it feels like its blending with the background its hard to see it sometimes. too many bright things.COMMENT_END",
      "Yoo, for sure 5 out 5. Controls are very smooth (i needed some time to figured it out how they work, but then i was destroying those level :). Levels was really well made. they are so different and yet interseting. It was a challenging experience and i really enjoyed playing it. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "My current favorite. It's already amazingly polished, the movement is satisfying, the gameplay is polished, and it felt great finally learning the controls. It definitely had a learning curve, but that's not a bad thing. You definitely outdid all of us :DCOMMENT_END",
      "The controls feel familiar yet fresh, which is hard to come by for platformers. Although, It took almost until the end of the jungle level before I properly understood the controls. The gameplay was really fun!COMMENT_END",

      "Maybe unusual to start my comments here, but I loved the sound of it - it really enhanced the game play.\u00a0\u00a0Movement also felt incredibly smooth and reactive. \u00a0Interesting mechanics and tricky levels.\u00a0 Maybe a bit too tricky for me at the beginning (I wish it was easier for longer). \u00a0Still, this is a great game and I hope you get to continue with it.COMMENT_END",
      "What a fun concept. I liked the mechanics and the puzzle levels. Had to get used to the movement a lot but it was a really fun game.COMMENT_END",
      "I had a lot of fun playing the game! Once I got the hang of the controls, it was fun to zip aroundCOMMENT_END",
      "Very cool and unique combination of movement mechanics. Your usage of environmental objects like the light blue thingies and the cracks were really great for making the world rich, colorful, and allowing for extra jumps/ cool stunt opportunities.I felt that maybe the camera might be a *bit* too jittery? Maybe I'm wrong, I love how fast it feels, but sometimes it feels difficult to read the text on screen because its moving around too much. That being said, your color palette decisions are off the charts good. You have a great sense of style and platformer level building. Can't wait to see where this one goes!COMMENT_END"

      "Firstly, I love the duck. Also the controls feel really nice, and I especially love the effect when you land after a double jump, although it almost makes me wish the normal jump and dash also had a bit of juice. There were a few issues I had with the movement though.\u00a0Firstly, fitting into one block gaps felt terrible there are a lot of them. Also, I think that the levels needed checkpoints. The music also looped over again with every death and together those made a rather grating experience. I also think the levels could have just been much shorter, as I would rather play 9 short levels than 3 long levels ten times out of ten. Since it's a game jam, not everybody will be willing to put the time and effort to be difficult or annoying games so I would highly recommend making them way easier than you may think they need to be. Also the jump pads don't allow you to double jump again and it feels like they should. I know I gave a lot of criticism but I did have a fun time, and if Rubber Ducky is coming back later I'd love to see some of this feedback taken into account. Great job & good luck!COMMENT_END",

I can't help but feel like the jump is less useful when you have the ability to teleport to the knife\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085 and I'm not sure the advantage of throwing it quickly?

Really great game, would love to see you keep working on this!COMMENT_END",

Still, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather have a twin-stick OR WASD+mouse movement.\nAlso, I the scissors go way too far out. I lose track of where they are. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be nice if they stayed closer and maybe inflict continuous damage OR stay in-view so I can plan for them to damage something on the way back to me when I recall them.COMMENT_END",

Once I got a hang of it it was really fun to kill all the bosses, the only one that gave me trouble was the one that leaves a fire trail behind it. I think the story and vibe of the game with the art and music is just great. The controls are pretty weird, I'd really like to be able to hold the mouse to move rather than having to spam click constantly while playing. Really great work on this I loved it.COMMENT_END",

      "AMAZING GAME! Amazing art Amazing story and i like how the mechanics lead into eachother! but i do have a couple nitpicks, the characther moves way too slow, and you can accidently dash WAY too far by just holding left click, this makes the game really a game of tanking damage and kill it before it kills you, which really decentive me from replaying it to get no-hit runs, the first time playing it its way too hard, and the second way too easy!! but overall still an amazing game, i had fun with the easier bosses where i could actually dodge and kinda run away the feedback is only kinda directed to the harder bossesCOMMENT_END",

      "I really like the idea but I found the game a little too difficult. It may need a little more aid to help identify where things are. If you play minesweeper you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a single number, every time you uncover a spot you may get up to 8 adjacent numbers. Then you can use overlaps and the numbers to figure out safe spots. I started playing and I was lucky that I placed a box and I got a 0, then I was safely placing boxes on the 4 corners of each box, as if it was traditional minesweeper and that was a good strategy, I could not devise any other strategy otherwise. I may also recommend/ask if there was a way to start a level with at least one shape placed in a safe spot to have something to start with.COMMENT_END",

      "Excellent job! I\u00a0had so much fun with this :)COMMENT_END",
      "Such an awesome take on the puzzle platformer genre. One of my favorite entries!COMMENT_END",
      "This is one of the best games in this jam. I've never seen a game like this, the idea of switching blocks, but being able to move inside these blocks is amazing. Good Job!COMMENT_END",
      "This is so awesome. The concept works so well and the variety shapes can be used for so many different things! In future levels you could even swap some of the shapes for even more possibilities.I'm guessing it's probably to save dev time, but I really liked the \"one big level\" approach which let the player go their own non-linear path. I say keep it like that, you can still have \"levels\" like a normal puzzle game but have each level contain a few coins that you can pick in whatever order you'd like.Only critique I have on the mechanics is that it did feel a bit janky when you were inbetween tiles, one puzzle could be solved by just spamming and hoping it lines up instead of doing the proper approach. But at the same time I like the fluidity of the movement, a grid based one maybe wouldn't feel as good. I guess you could make it so that the player smoothly \"snaps\" when you try to shapeshift, but otherwise have the movement as fluid as it is now.COMMENT_END",
      "This was such a cool mechanic! It was fun navigating the levels and trying to get all the coins shifting my block shapes around. I managed to get 9/10 coins, but the one in the top right I couldn't manage to get. Great work on this it's very cool!COMMENT_END",
      "This is amazing! Great mechanics, super fun!COMMENT_END",
      "Very unique idea and GREAT puzzles. Need more )COMMENT_END",
      "Very fun puzzles, and very unique concept for a platformer! I also love the art style, it's simple and cute. The gameplay kinda reminds me of some odd mobile games I would find on the app store. Not a bad thing, though. Gameplay mechanics were implemented beautifully. Not much else to say, you killed it!COMMENT_END",
      "Very nice idea!But dat\u00a0 music killing me xDCOMMENT_END",
      "Very GOODCOMMENT_END",
      "this is very well thought and implemented love the idea of fitting shapes to progress through out the levels and the level design is well madei like it alot!no i didnt played this for 10 minutes straight bcs of figuring out what shapes i should use to get a single coin where apparently i only need to use the T shape 2 times to get the coinCOMMENT_END",
      "very exciting mechanics. I hope to see the sequel!)COMMENT_END",
      "The shape changing and face moving mechanics were brilliant and fun! Great game!COMMENT_END",
      "Such a unique and interesting game idea! The jump felt really bad though, probably because of the lack of coyote time and because you couldn't even go up 1 tile, making it near useless. Sometimes it felt really hard to line up the shape right, maybe if they're close enough the shapes you turn into automatically snap into a grid so that you don't have to get them perfect. I think this would be really awesome as a metroidvania (metroidbrainia?) type game where you have to find new shapes to access different areas. I also kind of wish there was the ability to move my face without moving the shape (or needing a wall), especially since the WASD keys weren't used at all. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "Very clever. I think the game could benefit from implementing coyote time and jump buffering. That or you could\u00a0remove the ability to jump and make the player rely purely on the shape-shifting and face moving mechanics.COMMENT_END",
      "I was actually amazed on how smooth the movement and shape shifting were. A fantastic game overall!COMMENT_END",
      "Best game everCOMMENT_END",
      "I loved this puzzle game. \u00a0First, great tutorial system. \u00a0Second, clever and original mechanics. \u00a0Easy to learn and fun to play.\u00a0\u00a0This is a winner!COMMENT_END",
      "Great game. would love to play more levels weather during or after this jam!\u00a0\u00a0just nailed it...COMMENT_END",
      "Very creative idea and some very cool puzzle design. The gaps feel a little bit too tight. I think it is great for a puzzle game, but I get stuck easily trying to move the face, especially when trying to move the face down when I am in T shape. It might be better to make the movement grid-based for the tight puzzle design and avoid the stucking issue. Amazing game - can't wait to see what you make in round 2.COMMENT_END",
      "SO fun to play! :DCOMMENT_END",
      "coool !!!COMMENT_END",
      "This one was incredible as expected!\u00a0 Really good use of level design to really highlight your mechanics as well.\u00a0 The one, very nitpicky thing I would say is that there were a few times that I had it figured out but it wasn't letting me shapeshift because I wasn't in quite the right spot.\u00a0 \u00a0A little bit of wiggle room or \"close enough moves into place\" would be nice!\u00a0 All in all great job and a full five stars from me!COMMENT_END",
      "The shapeshift feels really satysfying to use since we can move in the form and the puzzles were fun. Can't wait to see even harder one with more shapeCOMMENT_END",
      "Nice spin on the classic platformer. In some cases I found it would be nice if the shape shifting was a little more forgiving, e.g. if it almost fits then just automatically move it to make it fit.COMMENT_END"

      "Fun little game for the first time, but doesn't really have anything after that. For me the game kept on lagging after not killing anything for a moment and killing one, and it was very easily replicated. The enemies were a bit too simplistic to get any difficulty out of them as they could be circled very easily.COMMENT_END",

      "The design is simple and effective: while maintaining minimal art, I\u00a0enjoyed the presence of key animations (enemy death, grabbing items), since they make the game modern despite keeping a retro feel.COMMENT_END",
      "Cool game!Once I realised I was running out of ammo, I was more conservative with my shooting.The dash mechanic was cool to burst through a horde of enemies!The screen shake got a bit nauseating after a little while, though.Nice job!COMMENT_END",
      "I really liked this game! It got repetitive after a while and if you do have ammo I feel it should be displayed somewhere, but that didn't stop me from having a great time. The dash feels really impactful, like you really are unleashing a powerful attack! I ended up getting a score of roughly 300 before I stopped. If you could find a way to make more variation throughout gameplay this could be a really cool game!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun game ! Not sure to fully understand why i can't shoot sometimes ? Looks like an ammo limitation.COMMENT_END",
      "Great work!COMMENT_END",
      "Feel good to play! The audio is simple but adds a lot. I had some horrible lag spikes on web on like every third kill, but on the downloadable version it was fine. I noticed there is some kind of ammo system, cause sometimes I can't shoot, I just wished this ammo was clearly communicated to the player so I knew how to \"save\" it more effectively.COMMENT_END",

The levels are great and I like that you expanded the challenges with achievements. Great game!COMMENT_END",
      "The rocket gameplay was great, but honestly the secondary fire felt a bit odd as the first bullet always hits the mouse's spot, so why have some random spread shotgun shot?

      "This is a cool game idea. I like simulated desktops in games for some reason idk why. I wasn't able to figure out the morse code part, there was one letter I couldn't figure out what it was.

It's also easy to find a morse translator, but since you have the hex translator, the morse translator should be added in the future.Aside from those nit-picks, this is great!

      "I think the mechanics of combat and spawning new fighters from those you kill work well together. There wasn't much feedback in the way of knowing how exactly the battles were working or not, and while that isn't part of the judging, I think it would have helped clarify what the core and secondary mechanics are and how they work. I could see this game has a lot of potential so I would like to see more. Plus, skeletons are awesome.COMMENT_END",

      "I love this concept - I only managed to beat a couple of levels, but the concept is very strong. My main issue was that the game plays very quickly right off the bat; if the earlier levels were slower and the later ones got faster, it would be easier to adjust to. I would like to see this idea developed further. Great job!COMMENT_END"

      "Ah, a fellow Construct 3 enjoyer! This is one of the better games that I've played this round. The mechanics were simple but unique enough to stand out. The intro cutscene was also charming. I'd like to see more!COMMENT_END",
      "This was a really fun platformer. I like the turn to stone mechanic I don't think I've seen it used in a platformer before and it lead to some interesting platforming. The art looks really nice, I think a parallax background would've helped give it a more complete look. The controls took me a bit to get used to, I'm so used to space being dash so I kinda killed myself a lot by accidentally turning into stone. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "This was a really enjoyable little platformer!\u00a0 The core mechanic of gliding and turning to stone is cleverly implemented and creates some satisfying puzzles.\u00a0 I especially liked\u00a0 the sound effects at most.\u00a0 My only minor critique would be that orbes looks like a coin and i always want to collect them :|\u00a0.\u00a0 Overall, though, a great entry!\u00a0 Well done!COMMENT_END",

      "This is definitely one of my favorites in this jam!\u00a0I love this platformer idea and would love to see it be developed further, everything about it is great (small story, graphics, and polish like chef's kiss). It challenged me and I was able to get 54 seconds on the leaderboard. Maybe it was just the leaderboard and I'm just competitive lol.COMMENT_END",
      "This is a really fun platformer game. Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun platformer game. Was a bit lost at first as other than being given controls, I did not know what the bubbles and dragon fly did so I was stuck a bit when the dragonfly was introduced. Turns out I had to land on top so there was a bit of precision needed there that didn't leave room for error. Great use of mechanics for the puzzles!COMMENT_END"

      "Very nice 3D\u00a0platformer with quite a big level. I lost the purple ball at some point unfortunately (when you have to hit the big red button). Also I agree with MessMess that the precision platforming on the tiny platforms in the very beginning felt a bit too hardcore, especially given the easier section that comes just after.COMMENT_END",
      "Your game is amazing. I liked the platforming, especially near the start area with the sneaky placed hidden star to find. I got quite far and the pull and push mechanics are well implemented. I tried a number of things to get the bouncy ball to the switch but I couldn't figure it out unfortunately so I had to stop at 8 stars. I like the interesting challenges you created and the generous respawn spots definitely helpedCOMMENT_END",
      "Tough game but I love that it doesn't make you do everything again after falling. Simplistic graphics but they work well for the game. The music, animations, and particles all added to the environment and feel of the game very well. Some of the interactions with the boxes and balls could have used more polish even if you cant fix every bug : )COMMENT_END",
      "A lot of work went into this one.\u00a0 It's a very tricky platformer, but it did let you restart play quickly after failing.\u00a0 I got stuck attempting to get the very first star, which was hidden below the main plarform.\u00a0 The instructions were well done.COMMENT_END",

      "I had a lot of fun playing this one! I also really liked the attention to details, like the instructions, cube flipping for double jump or spinning for dash, etc...\u00a0 My main suggestion would be, purely for the sake of getting yourself the best rating you can, try to make it extra clear what you consider your main two mechanics.\u00a0 I assumed platforming and moving the blocks?\u00a0 But I wasn't super sureCOMMENT_END",

      "I loved this game. I love 3d platformers and platformers in general so this was great. The movement felt tight and there were a good number of mechanic with the dash and double jump and different obstacles to get around. I think I cheated a bit cuz I was able to get ontop of the wall and completely bypass the section where you're supposed to launch a box into the switch. My only complaint is that the game made me stop playing when I got the flag, and that's when I noticed I only got 9/10 stars. I would've loved to go back and find that last star. Really great job on this I had so much fun playing it.COMMENT_END",

Very very cool.I would say some really brief demonstration of the mechanic at the beginning (like a tutorial but just like... a 2 second animation or something demonstrating rather than a description tutorial) that would be cool.

      "This is a really cool idea. I love automation games so it was fun to get some automata working for me. It'd be nice if you could see what materials you needed for stuff in the shop menu too, cuz I found myself going back and forth a lot to figure out what to craft for profit. I ended up just making a ton of heads over time to make money. It'd be cool if you could make automata sell and buy stuff too, I would've liked to setup a full automation of making and selling heads so I could just watch my workers make money for me lol. Great job on this I had fun playing it!COMMENT_END",

      "Hi there!First of all, congratulations on submitting for GDKO 2025!Your game doesn't seem to have any direction towards progression.\u00a0I felt like I was clicking buttons and hearing noises without ever seeing anything to show for it.The minigame was brilliant, albeit a little bit janky to move around, but still a great premise!The sound clips were very high in reverb, which would work well with a backing track of music, but by themselves it definitely made the game feel even more empty.The art style is great, and\u00a0would work even better\u00a0if the 3D models were implemented.Thanks!COMMENT_END"

I was streaming myself playing it and the people in chat couldn't stop saying how cool this game was and how awesome the music was. I haven't finished it quite yet, need to go back tomorrow and beat it. But I made it a bit past the door boss. One frustrating thing that happened was I was using the mouse to move and I think the game continues moving after a fight based on your last mouse movement maybe? But as soon as I beat the door boss my character walked into the door and right back down so I had to fight it again. I don't think I clicked anywhere after fighting the boss, but maybe I did idk. Really awesome work on this game it is so so cool, one of my favs from the jam so far.COMMENT_END",

      "- Tabbing without the \"interaction\" area close by breaks the mouse as it doesn't release and movement stops or keeps going on its own- The menu at the start isVERYdifficult to see, as I had to look at the video to figure out where it was- General bad FPS, but that is to be expected from UE5- Transitioning to the other level completely bricked the controls but the game didn't crash- Couldn't really figure out what the spells were supposed to be as there were four different direction keys to be used- Development build, that's it.Interesting idea that could probably be developed further, but currently it is very bare bones.COMMENT_END",
      "Its a very nice looking game! I know you mentioned before that these are premade assets, but it comes together nice. I will say though that I think some more work should be put into the \"game loop\" as far as how the player can understand it. The game kinda tells you what to do in a little text box for a few seconds, but as a player I didnt really know how that should work. Eventually I sussed it out, but after that I still didnt know what the objective was. Eventually I found the enemies outside I could beat, but that seemed to be it.

After playing through it again now, I think I know why some people get overrun by enemies while others don't: you don't know where the enemies are coming from, so if you are simply looking another way you will get back stabbed, and it will feel more difficult.COMMENT_END",

I had some trouble estimating volley trajectories not sure if there could be some visual feedback (maybe locked behind an upgrade).COMMENT_END",

      "I love this concept! Found the controls quite difficult at first, and I think that it would be good to start the game off with a slower speed, to ease the player into the gameplay. Would love to see this developed further if you choose to keep working on it!! :)COMMENT_END",
      "I wasn't very good at it but it was fun and a great concept!\u00a0 Good job!COMMENT_END",
      "The \"aiming\" or just movement felt a bit weird, maybe floatly even. Idea was quite clear but as a person who hasn't interacted with sushi much I had some trouble understanding what went where, but it cleared after a few total failures. To me at least the game was a bit too fast, but that also cleared the further I went.COMMENT_END",
      "I liked it a lot even tho I was having such a hard time lol. The art looks great and once you get the hang of it the game feels satisfying but early on ots pretty hard.COMMENT_END",
      "Took me a lot of tries to get used to the game. Maybe start off a little slower and have the belt slowly speed up to let the player get a chance to see what's going on and experiment a little. Other than that, I think the game has a lot of potential for future development.COMMENT_END",
      "Cool concept, and a good start which can be expanded on!COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool concept took me a second to get used to the fact the mouse wasn't lined up with the chopsticks but the sensitivity helped a lot.COMMENT_END",
      "It's hard!\u00a0Like real chopsticks! ) Very fun idea )COMMENT_END",
      "Well done submitting!I struggled a bit to understand exactly what\u00a0I had to do in the beginning, but picked it up after a few plays. The movement of the items seems fixed in\u00a0acceleration, which made it difficult to hone in on the sushi. And the learning curve is much too fast to begin with. Slowing the train down drastically in the beginning would give the player a chance to grasp the mechanic, before then speeding it up over time.Definitely has potential, I hope to see more projects in the future!COMMENT_END",
      "I liked the mechanics, it was challenging but fun.\u00a0 Though I did have trouble with aiming, and it could use some sounds,\u00a0it was a pretty good game!COMMENT_END",
      "Hello! Was a bit of a challenge for me. But when I understood the task it was quite a fun. Aiming felt a bit weird, because at first I wanted to grab objects with chopsticks. Some sounds and background music would add a lot for this game. I liked it!COMMENT_END",
      "Cool concept, it took me a while to understand that I was losing (didn't notice the plate straight up) but it was very fun after I fully understood itCOMMENT_END",

      "Super fun and addicting game!\u00a0My only advice would be that some of the upgrades didn't feel as impactful as\u00a0I would have liked, for example lvl 4 damage increase still took 2 hits to kill a basic ant, the same amount at lvl 0, and 3 hits for one of the stronger ones which I think was the same for like level 1 or 2. I would love to see how it's expanded upon, like more unique upgrades that have cool synergies for example or puzzles and new methods of combat with the two core mechanics here.\u00a0Also as a pretty small nitpick punching the candy felt\u00a0 very punishing which led to me avoiding the punch radius mechanics, maybe it could be lessened or the upgrade that protects against ant or hold damage would also help for punches. Overall I had a great time, nice job!COMMENT_END",

      "Very cool puzzle game. I liked the crafting system a lot. I accidentally played thru the beginning so fast that the narration assumed I'd played the game before and stopped lol. Took me a little bit to figure out how some stuff worked, like the box being able to store items, but I got thru the whole game in the end. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "Props for being the first game I've run into this jam to have narration. The art style was interesting and audio was good. The crafting mechanic and certain puzzles were quite unclear at first but cleared up fast.COMMENT_END",

I really liked playing it!\u00a0The narrating is amazing as well,\u00a0very fun, 10/10. I'm a little worried about the narrator tho, you might want to check if they got murdered or smth since they never came back to us.COMMENT_END",

      "Great rage game :) To keep my sanity I had to find another way to beat it. I ended up pushing into the left wall, waiting to be pushed out and then jumping and pushing left again to get on top of the next block in the wall, and climbing up all the way like that.COMMENT_END",
      "Very fun, but very tricky! I do think it's a little slippery, but thatdoesadd to the challenge of it. More levels in the future could be very fun to see.COMMENT_END",
      "Very cool idea :)COMMENT_END",
      "I liked the mechanics a lot. I feel like they could use a bit more visual feedback (the bars are helpful but aren't particularly fun to look at, versus more elaborate player animation). However, your level building was great and progressed in difficulty the perfect amount. I enjoyed the tough deceleration and heavy feel of the droid. Very solid entry!COMMENT_END",
      "COMMENT_END",
      "Tough but fun to play - nice one. You definitely succeeded with your aim of inducing rage, but also satisfaction ;)COMMENT_END",
      "Wish I could slow down a bit better :D I did notice a small bug that can be exploited, you can climb the big wall on the left to go all the way up, as the character clips on the \"floor\" of each wall block, allowing you to jump out of the block to the one above, if you wiggle at the right momentCOMMENT_END",

      "This is another game that was really fun, but I was terrible at it.\u00a0\u00a0I really liked the mechanics and how the jump and hover could work together. \u00a0Also, not a big thing, but I love the robot logo on your start screen.\u00a0 Really well done game!COMMENT_END",

      "I really enjoyed playing thru this game. It does a good job of being a rage game without being crazy frustrating thanks to the hover mechanic. I think the controls are a bit slippery in terms of turning around or slowing yourself down when coming down from a hover, but maybe that's by design for the rage game. Great job on this it's a lot of fun!COMMENT_END",
      "Really fun, also not much of a rage game since the boosters give you a sense of control yet it keeps it hard. Solid execution!COMMENT_END",
      "Great mechanic, I see the potential to induce rage among those who progress far and have to restart (me included), but the sense of accomplishment is satisfying.COMMENT_END",
      "Cool mechanic. Allows for traversal and there are lots of opportunities to allow for even more progression via upgrades and stuff. It's tough! I got to the 3rd elevator platform a few times but just kept falling off :DWell done!COMMENT_END",
      "Great game overall! Didn't get very far, but it didn't take that much to see the potential. Gameplay feels good for the most part,\u00a0but you need to spare a bit of patience. Not much else to say, keep up the good work!COMMENT_END",

      "Fun game! Though there could've been a bit more challenge near the end, as you can just hold shift and spam WASD and the arrow keys and it works out. Maybe having each day have a set goal could remedy that. Otherwise it was a fun fast-paced game!COMMENT_END",

      "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fun concept. I enjoyed the gameCOMMENT_END",
      "I thought it was pretty fun, the music is scratching my brain in a way I didn't know I liked.\u00a0 Only thing is I think maybe adding a penalty for pressing the wrong key would be nice cause I ended up just button mashing and got a high score of 89. So some way to punish that could be fun. All around though I think it's a solid game.COMMENT_END",

      "This was fun, I love pushing arrow keys in sequence so this was right up my alley. I really enjoyed it once I had all the upgrades and could hold shift to go through the patterns really quick, I was so bad at the teal one every time. Great job on this, I got 140 boxes with a high score of 27.COMMENT_END",

Fast paced action as you progress more, but that was kinda nullified by the fact you can actually just spam the keys and get the correct one, which also skips the delay entirely. Interesting graphical style and Wii-style gameplay.COMMENT_END",
      "The initial slow button pressing was kinda tiresome, BUT immediately after the first upgrade &\u00a0management system the game became more enjoyable.\u00a0Gotta also give ++ points for fun writing and distinctive industrial art style.COMMENT_END",

      "I really like the Idea, huge fan of mechanics with high reward/risk so the freeze for heal was fun. Would absolutly love see this getting continued into a full gameCOMMENT_END",
      "The mechanics, shooting and healing worked pretty well together. Deciding when to freeze and for how long in order to heal is a novel idea. I\u00a0think the game has a lot of potential. I think it could use a bit of polish as well to make things run smoother to better demonstrate the mechanics you implemented. But it's a good start.COMMENT_END",
      "After retrying the game it decided to work, no clue what has changed since the latest update is from before trying to play it, oh well. It was rather bare bones and the enemies kept getting stuck as their pathfinding is probably just move towards the player. Also the player could go into negative integers and it wasn't some one off as it happened every time. The trees also were so large they blocked the enemies and the player's movement.COMMENT_END",
      "I like the secondary mechanic. The inability to move is a huge risk but it can pay off if you get enough healing. Could be fun to expand :)COMMENT_END",

Still not really sure lol, I\u00a0couldn't really solve any by myself.\u00a0 I agree with the other feedback about the difficulty progression, some easier ones at the beginning would be great!\u00a0The puzzle in the menu was really good and a good start to the\u00a0game!COMMENT_END",
      "I love puzzle games and thought I would love this, but it's just so hard and cryptic, right from the start.\u00a0\u00a0I think you really need to start easier and let us learn and get better as we go. \u00a0Or it might just be that\u00a0I am dumb. :)COMMENT_END",
      "I would love to see more of this game!\u00a0 As others have mentioned it definitely has a steep learning curve and was pretty confusing to get started with, but I think it has a LOT of potential.COMMENT_END",
      "Wow I\u00a0really like your core mechanic, lots of potential to build off of it! I will admit, the puzzles had me confused in general: I liked the main menu as a sort of \"puzzle\" and think that one worked well, but once in the game itself I think it could use a little more guidance to help the player get on the right track with solving puzzles.COMMENT_END",
      "I really like the idea of this game!I have to admit that I struggled a bit and could never do it without Solution \u00f0\u009f\u0098Also the\u00a0 Sounds of the Flute could be a little louder.Hope this gets developed further!COMMENT_END",

      "Very clever idea. I especially liked how the start menu itself is a puzzle. The only thing missing is some form of feedback so the player knows when they did something right.COMMENT_END",
      "I think probably I'm just too dumb to play this type of game. I managed to get some doors open but through sheer luck of randomly pressing keys to get the right code. No idea how you would work them out haha. All the same pretty cool, and I'd like to have another go at some point.COMMENT_END",
      "LOOOOOVE this type of game.COMMENT_END",
      "Really liked this game. I\u00a0also liked not being given much and having to figure it out. I couldn't open a few of the doors, but I\u00a0found a glowing thing that said \"under construction.\" Great game, one of my favorites from this round.COMMENT_END",
      "I dig this game - it took a while to understand the controls but once I did it was a pretty cool puzzle game! I'm convinced one of the doors is impossible to beat, and I ran into a second door where I think the texture that shows the pattern to open it was missing.COMMENT_END",

      "Very cool game. I like the blueprint- construction art style. The mechanics are creative. It feels great that many levels can have multiple solutions since you can choose where the door should be. Great job!COMMENT_END",
      "Love the mechanics, and the graphics. In particular, graphics has something special about it, like an actual art direction. The only bothersome thing is that I have to position the door on each restart, would be better if they stayed where you left them and relocation was optional.\u00a0Level 7 was too much for my brain, sadly I had to resign there. But really great work, and game does have potential.COMMENT_END",
      "Level design/progression is good since it gives you some freedom to figure out the puzzles.\u00a0Aiming is also\u00a0well-done, I like how the ball speed depends on the click\u00a0distance.\u00a0Reminds me of some older\u00a0Android games, I believe there are a lot of extra\u00a0mechanics left to add if wanted.COMMENT_END",
      "The score / time moving really hurt my brains when I tried to calculate how to shoot. Also I apparently missed the balls velocity being tied to the mouse position, so I tried to spam the ball in totally stupid spots. The door being stationary probably could've opened up the game for another mechanic. Interesting concept and art style, could develop further into a full scale indie game.COMMENT_END",

      "Was a fun game (completed all the levels) and the door placing game a bit more freedom when trying to find a solution, would suggest modifying where you can put the door as currently you can just put the door on top of the last star you'll collect making the best solution often just slapping it on top off a star.COMMENT_END",
      "Hey, cool game, nice unique concept and good puzzle design! I beat the whole thing and it was not easy lol. I had the ball go into freakout mode a couple times, maybe you can add a max speed to the ball so it can never go out of control?But regardless, I had fun. Nice work!P.S. I loved the idea of choosing where to put the door. I think that's so cool. I say stick with this one!COMMENT_END",

      "I absolutely love this concept!!!! I will come back when the voting beigns.COMMENT_END",
      "This was a really nicely presented and fun puzzle game. I think the mechanics worked well together and you did a great job of slowly inbtroducing concepts to the player and exploring differnt ideas as the levels progressed. The tutorial text was clear and helpful.\u00a0I thought the actual mechanics were well implemented and everything, at least on my playthrough, worked really well. I saw you put quite a few times about the 'Wonky physics' but i wouldnt worry too much about it, I think people expect some oddities with physics based games and its part of the charm!I found it a little unintuative that the distance of the mouse controlled the power. My muscle memory kept taking over and assuming that it was how long i help the mouse down for, so id just have to watch the ball pathetically dribble away out the cannon at no speed quite a lot \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b2.\u00a0 That is on me though i think. However, i really would love to be able to just re-shoot without replacing the door! especially when i kept messing up.COMMENT_END",
      "Super fun! Unique game, with polished mechanics. I do agree with what others have said about adding some sort of visual indication of the power. Well done, such a great entry!!COMMENT_END",
      "This was fun, a really solid puzzle game and I especially liked the portal mechanic. It'd be nice if there was some indicator of how far you were going to shoot the ball. Great job on this I had fun playing thru it!COMMENT_END",
      "A game about a bouncing ball, that's my jam! It works well, and the art looks nice. I found the controls for moving the door a bit odd; it would be easier if you could just drag it.COMMENT_END",
      "I love this kind of puzzle game - lots of fun to play.\u00a0 I did think the levels got harder a bit too quickly, but that is an easy thing to fix after the jam.\u00a0\u00a0This is great (a favorite of mine) and I hope you get to keep working on it.COMMENT_END",

      "YOU COOKEDThis is actually so insanely well done, crazy you made this in 2 weeks.I wanna see more!(Really small UI suggestion, maybe have an arrow that shrinks/scales with the mouse distance away from the cannon, so it becomes really obvious how much power the ball will shoot out with)COMMENT_END",

      "Was a ton of fun playing this on stream.\u00a0 Felt like a cool mix of like Runescape and Civilization\u00a0(which sounds strange, but totally works).COMMENT_END",
      "I like this game! I think it works just right mechanically to keep me going for the next rounds! Each new ability makes me want more haha If you have time to make anymore tweaks (or taking suggestions for round 2), could i suggest a little bit of wait time between ending your turn and seeing the effects of the enemy's turn? I like that the enemy's turn doesnt take up time, but the effects of their turn happen like maybe even before the game displays that its their turnCOMMENT_END"

      "I haven't see this concept before. This for sure has some potential. Good!COMMENT_END",
      "Very nice demo! I felt like it was pretty easy to survive though, so it could use some balancing to make it more challenging.COMMENT_END",

      "Wow there is a lot of potential with this game, I really enjoyed playing this! Aside from the obvious UI touch-ups and more information given to the player (such as which color dice do what) I'd also recommend showing what the player has equipped so far when they're choosing their item reward after a battle.COMMENT_END",
      "I liked this! A lot of potential, I would like to play an actual roguelike game like this. Just add more strategy and abilities and enemies and it will be perfect.\u00a0I recommend making a webgl build in the future tho, especially if continuing with unity, you deserve more people to try this out but downloadable files tend to scare them away.COMMENT_END",

      "Nice concept! The 2D side would have benefited from some coyote time for the jump. Like Dev Pirates said it would be cool if the 3D side could be used to progress on the 2D side as well.COMMENT_END",
      "This could've been something like \"We were here\" but it was a extremely thin slice of a very cookie cutter platformer. The graphics were simple and served their purpose well. Not that many features or elements to comment on.COMMENT_END",
      "Making the way through\u00a0the 3D level and the 2D level is a really great idea. I liked the buttons in the 2D part that helped the progression of the 3D. I think you hit the theme of the challenge really well and it was a lot of fun. Well done!COMMENT_END",
      "This is soo cool! I liked this so much!COMMENT_END",
      "This was really interesting and very original.\u00a0\u00a0I was great jumping in 3d, but my 2d game was terrible (not your fault - mine). \u00a0I enjoyed this and hope you get a chance to continue it.COMMENT_END",
      "Interesting concept. I look forward to seeing how how you further integrate the 2d & 3d spaces.COMMENT_END"

      "Now that the game is working, it is an artsy game. The game itself is short and simple, but the art style does most of the heavy lifting. Now just more areas, interactions or something completely different and it could stand on its own. AlsoThe giant is real.COMMENT_END",
      "I LOVE YOUR ART OMGsorry for the caps..i love your take on this im assuming the core is to collect items and to support that and progress you give the food to the animals and when you give them food they are coloured giving a sense that they're happy nowpretty simple idea but well executed as a prototype this is greati'd love to see this being developed furtheroh yeah btw a random thing happen where the characters leg went so big after i put the berries down near the bushi jumped thought the girl went giant mode \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00adCOMMENT_END",
      "This game is so cute omg I can't handle it. I really enjoyed feeding the animals their respective foods and would love to see more added to the game, or really any game you make with your art style it is so adorable I love it. Great work on this!COMMENT_END",
      "I really like your art style and even though this was a very simple game, you managed to add a lot of personality to it, which is something a lot of devs (including myself) seems to struggle with. The game itself\u00a0was very intuitive and easy to progress.COMMENT_END",

      "I really went out of my way to try and play this game, but everything I could come up with failed. Download gamemaker and the file throws a million errors, not even the yyp fixer works as it isn't a \"valid project\". Can't really give a rating without having even touched the game itself, a shame honestly.COMMENT_END",

      "Overall good experience! I love the games with this pixel vibe, good job with post processing. Also atmosphere was a bit scary and I loved that image with boy. Wind sounds are not on the loop, so they end after a while. I got a bit confused in the maze and couldn't finish the game.COMMENT_END",

      "Very cool game concept and mechanics. It's a little tough, but maybe\u00a0I'm just bad LOL. It would be cool to be able to rotate in either direction and to slow the initial game down a little. Great job though, really enjoyed it!COMMENT_END",
      "I unfortunately couldn't get past the first spikes as I have such a skill issue with precise games, so I probably missed entirely what the secondary mechanic was. The graphics were nice enough that I probably would've wanted to play more if I could've. Not going to say what the camera's problem was as everyone else has already said it.COMMENT_END",
      "Very rage inducing but very very fun! the rotating effect is a lil much but Its cool!!COMMENT_END",
      "Very dizzy now. Great game with good mechanics. Loved the winding up of the doors and the no spin zones mixed with the treadmills. Great game!COMMENT_END",

      "COMMENT_END",
      "This was so freakin' fun to play on stream.\u00a0 I could see this being a fantastic game on mobile especially.COMMENT_END",
      "Really clever and original idea. \u00a0Definitely a dizzying. \u00a0I started out okay, but it got too hard (for me) really fast. \u00a0I think just spinning a little slower would help it (both for dizzy and skill). \u00a0Still, it was very fun.COMMENT_END",
      "Good job. I had fun.COMMENT_END",
      "loved thistho the spinning made me dizzy a bit lolnice work man!i think our characater might wanna take some dizzy medicineCOMMENT_END",
      "Are you crazy man? How did you come up with all these systems? I am sick of all the spinning, and each obstacle you threw my way kept me wanting to try even more! I was so close to giving up ALL THE TIME! But then you had a new way to interact with the game I was even more hooked!I had to stop on that winding path that I had to screw in 3-4\u00a0 bulbs at the start to turn (Another genius interaction!!!) but then I reached the end, admittedly after taking my (spoon)sweet time, and the door was closed... that was my final moment :D Let me know if there is more or if someone actually streamed the next puzzles! Amazing game!COMMENT_END",
      "Fun and interesting mechanic that was surprisingly challenging! Agreed with others that the camera spinning was a little offputting and made it difficult to look at and follow, but I really like the idea overallCOMMENT_END",
      "I really enjoyed this one. It starts off so simple, but you really explored a lot of mechanics to ramp up the difficulty with the areas that lock your rotation and the timed gates and stuff. I really appreciated the generous checkpointing as well as I found the pretty tough. Great work on this I\u00a0like it!COMMENT_END",
      "Was slightly nauseating but extremely fun! I didn't want to stop playing but I had to\u00a0due to the spins getting to me. extremely fun and I could see this being fleshed out into a full game, good job!COMMENT_END",
      "Great execution of the task! The camera spinning makes it a bit hard to look at thoughCOMMENT_END",
      "This to me was a perfect submission for the criteria!\u00a0 Really brilliant use of level design with simple and easy to grasp mechanics to make a game that I had a lot of fun with.\u00a0 First all fives of the round for me!COMMENT_END",
      "I think I'm a little bit overspun\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00aeCOMMENT_END",
      "Lets gooo 5 minutes before the bell rang!!!Its a great game a lot of spinning, looking forward to seeing how you expand this!!COMMENT_END",
      "Great idea and great execution! I also agree that rotating the character would make the game more accessible, but this was a fun experience nonetheless.COMMENT_END",
      "Banger game, but please just make the character rotate instead of the screen. I got nauseous playing for like 5 minutes. The core and secondary mechanic are super well implemented.\u00a0Great job!!COMMENT_END"
